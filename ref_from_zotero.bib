	doi = {10.3171/2022.6.JNS2297},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE  Broca’s aphasia is a syndrome of impaired fluency with retained comprehension. The authors used an unbiased algorithm to examine which neuroanatomical areas are most likely to result in Broca’s aphasia following surgical lesions.
METHODS  Patients were prospectively evaluated with standardized language batteries before and after surgery. Broca’s area was defined anatomically as the pars opercularis and triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. Broca’s aphasia was defined by the Western Aphasia Battery language assessment. Resections were outlined from MRI scans to construct 3D volumes of interest. These were aligned using a nonlinear transformation to Montreal Neurological Institute brain space. A voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) algorithm was used to test for areas statistically associated with Broca’s aphasia when incorporated into a resection, as well as areas associated with deficits in fluency independent of Western Aphasia Battery classification. Postoperative MRI scans were reviewed in blinded fashion to estimate the percentage resection of Broca’s area compared to areas identified using the VLSM algorithm.
RESULTS  A total of 289 patients had early language evaluations, of whom 19 had postoperative Broca’s aphasia. VLSM analysis revealed an area that was highly correlated (p {\textless} 0.001) with Broca’s aphasia, spanning ventral sensorimotor cortex and supramarginal gyri, as well as extending into subcortical white matter tracts. Reduced fluency scores were significantly associated with an overlapping region of interest. The fluency score was negatively correlated with fraction of resected precentral, postcentral, and supramarginal components of the VLSM area.
CONCLUSIONS  Broca’s aphasia does not typically arise from neurosurgical resections in Broca’s area. When Broca’s aphasia does occur after surgery, it is typically in the early postoperative period, improves by 1 month, and is associated with resections of ventral sensorimotor cortex and supramarginal gyri. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.6.JNS2297},

Several studies have demonstrated psychophysical forward entrainment in a pitch-discrimination task. In a recent paper, Lin et al.

They concluded that rhythmic sequences do not facilitate pitch discrimination. Here, we describe several methodological and stimulus design flaws in Lin et al.’s study that may explain their failure to observe forward entrainment in pitch discrimination.},

	abstract = {Single unit recordings have provided us with a basis for understanding the auditory system, especially about how it behaves under stimulation with simple sounds such as clicks and tones. The experimental as well as the theoretical approach to single unit studies has been dichotomous. One approach, the more familiar, gives a representation of nervous system activity in the form of peri-stimulus-time (PST) histograms, period histograms, iso-intensity rate curves and frequency tuning curves. This approach observes the neural output of units in the various nuclei in the auditory nervous system, and, faced with the random way in which the neurons respond to sound, proceeds by repeatedly presenting the same stimulus in order to obtain averaged results. These are the various histogram procedures (Gerstein \& Kiang, 1960; Kiang

A mathematical model was obtained that can predict quantitatively, with reasonable accuracy, the nonlinear, dynamic behavior of the neuron chain. The applicability of the method is discussed.

	abstract = {Purpose: Aims in this study are to (1) develop a computational model observer which reliably tracks the detectability of human observers in low dose computed tomography (CT) images reconstructed with knowledge-based iterative reconstruction (IMR™, Philips Healthcare) and filtered back projection (FBP) across a range of independent variables, (2) use the model to evaluate detectability trends across reconstructions and make predictions of human observer detectability, and (3) perform human observer studies based on model predictions to demonstrate applications of the model in CT imaging.
Methods: Detectability (d′) was evaluated in phantom studies across a range of conditions. Images were generated using a numerical CT simulator. Trained observers performed 4-alternative forced choice (4-AFC) experiments across dose (1.3, 2.7, 4.0 mGy), pin size (4, 6, 8 mm), contrast (0.3\%, 0.5\%, 1.0\%), and reconstruction (FBP, IMR), at fixed display window. A five-channel Laguerre–Gauss channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) was developed with internal noise added to the decision variable and/or to channel outputs, creating six different internal noise models. Semianalytic internal noise computation was tested against Monte Carlo and used to accelerate internal noise parameter optimization. Model parameters were estimated from all experiments at once using maximum likelihood on the probability correct, PC. Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare models of different orders. The best model was selected according to AIC and used to predict detectability in blended FBP-IMR images, analyze trends in IMR detectability improvements, and predict dose savings with IMR. Predicted dose savings were compared against 4-AFC study results using physical CT phantom images.
Results: Detection in IMR was greater than FBP in all tested conditions. The CHO with internal noise proportional to channel output standard deviations, Model-k4, showed the best trade-off between fit and model complexity according to AICc. With parameters fixed, the model reasonably predicted detectability of human observers in blended FBP-IMR images. Semianalytic internal noise computation gave results equivalent to Monte Carlo, greatly speeding parameter estimation. Using Model-k4, the authors found an average detectability improvement of 2.7 ± 0.4 times that of FBP. IMR showed greater improvements in detectability with larger signals and relatively consistent improvements across signal contrast and x-ray dose. In the phantom tested, Model-k4 predicted an 82\% dose reduction compared to FBP, verified with physical CT scans at 80\% reduced dose.
Conclusions: IMR improves detectability over FBP and may enable significant dose reductions. A channelized Hotelling observer with internal noise proportional to channel output standard deviation agreed well with human observers across a wide range of variables, even across reconstructions with drastically different image characteristics. Utility of the model observer was demonstrated by predicting the effect of image processing (blending), analyzing detectability improvements with IMR across dose, size, and contrast, and in guiding real CT scan dose reduction experiments. Such a model observer can be applied in optimizing parameters in advanced iterative reconstruction algorithms as well as guiding dose reduction protocols in physical CT experiments.

Determining whether these descriptions are generated by mechanisms that are independent from object-based sampling procedures requires that we investigate how internal noise, external noise, and sampling affect subjects’ performance. Here we systematically manipulated the external variability of ensembles and used variance summation modeling to estimate both the internal noise and the number of samples that affected the representation of ensemble average size. The results suggest that humans sample many more than one or two items from an array when forming an estimate of the average size, and that the internal noise that affects ensemble processing is lower than the noise that affects the processing of single objects. These results are discussed in light of other recent modeling efforts and suggest that ensemble processing of average size relies on a mechanism that is distinct from segmenting individual items. This ensemble process may be more similar to texture processing.},

	abstract = {Lexical decision is one of the most frequently used tasks in word recognition research. Theoretical conclusions are typically derived from a linear model on the reaction times (RTs) of correct word trials only (e.g., linear regression and ANOVA). Although these models estimate random measurement error for RTs, considering only correct trials implicitly assumes that word/non-word categorizations are without noise: words receive a yesresponse because they have been recognized, and they receive a no-response when they are not known. Hence, when participants are presented with the same stimuli on two separate occasions, they are expected to give the same response. We demonstrate that this not true and that responses in a lexical decision task suffer from inconsistency in participants’ response choice, meaning that RTs of “correct” word responses include RTs of trials on which participants did not recognize the stimulus. We obtained estimates of this internal noise using established methods from sensory psychophysics (Burgess and Colborne, 1988). The results show similar noise values as in typical psychophysical signal detection experiments when sensitivity and response bias are taken into account (Neri, 2010). These estimates imply that, with an optimal choice model, only 83–91\% of the response choices can be explained (i.e., can be used to derive theoretical conclusions). For word responses, word frequencies below 10 per million yield alarmingly low percentages of consistent responses (near 50\%). The same analysis can be applied to RTs, yielding noise estimates about three times higher. Correspondingly, the estimated amount of consistent trial-level variance in RTs is only 8\%. These ﬁgures are especially relevant given the recent popularity of trial-level lexical decision models using the linear mixed-effects approach (e.g., Baayen et al., 2008).},

	abstract = {As an information-bearing auditory attribute of sound, pitch plays a crucial role in the perception of speech and music. Studies examining pitch processing in autism spectrum disorder have produced equivocal results. To understand this discrepancy from a mechanistic perspective, we used a novel data-driven method, the reverse-correlation paradigm, to explore whether the equivocal findings in autism spectrum disorder have high-level origins in top–down comparisons of internal mental representations of pitch contours. Thirty-two Mandarin-speaking autistic individuals and 32 non-autistic individuals undertook three subtasks testing mental representations of pitch contours in speech, complex tone and melody, respectively. The results indicate that while the two groups exhibited similar representations of pitch contours across the three conditions, the autistic group showed a significantly higher intra-group variability than the non-autistic group. In addition, the two groups did not differ significantly in internal noise, a measure of the robustness of participant responses to external variability, suggesting that the present findings translate genuinely qualitative differences and similarities between groups in pitch processing. These findings uncover for the first time that pitch patterns in speech and music are mentally represented in a similar manner in autistic and non-autistic individuals, through domain-general top–down mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Cochlear implant (CI) performance varies considerably across individuals and across domains of auditory function, but clinical testing is typically restricted to speech intelligibility. The goals of this study were (a) to develop a basic auditory skills evaluation battery of tests for comprehensive assessment of ecologically relevant aspects of auditory perception and (b) to compare CI listeners' performance on the battery when tested in the laboratory by an audiologist or independently at home.
            
            
              Method
              The battery included 17 tests to evaluate (a) basic spectrotemporal processing, (b) processing of music and environmental sounds, and (c) speech perception in both quiet and background noise. The battery was administered online to three groups of adult listeners: two groups of postlingual CI listeners and a group of older normal-hearing (ONH) listeners of similar age. The ONH group and one CI group were tested in a laboratory by an audiologist, whereas the other CI group self-tested independently at home following online instructions.
            
            
              Results
              Results indicated a wide range in the performance of CI but not ONH listeners. Significant differences were not found between the two CI groups on any test, whereas on all but two tests, CI listeners' performance was lower than that of the ONH participants. Principal component analysis revealed that four components accounted for 82\% of the variance in measured results, with component loading indicating that the test battery successfully captures differences across dimensions of auditory perception.
            
            
              Conclusions
              These results provide initial support for the use of the basic auditory skills evaluation battery for comprehensive online assessment of auditory skills in adult CI listeners.},

While their encoding has been widely investigated in neurophysiology, we still lack a full understanding of how STMs are processed at the behavioral level and how cochlear hearing loss impacts this processing. Here, we introduce a novel methodological framework based on psychophysical reverse correlation deployed in the modulation space to characterize the mechanisms underlying STM detection in noise. We derive perceptual filters for young normal-hearing and older hearing-impaired individuals performing a detection task of an elementary target STM (a given product of temporal and spectral modulations) embedded in other masking STMs. Analyzed with computational tools, our data show that both groups rely on a comparable linear (band-pass)–nonlinear processing cascade, which can be well accounted for by a temporal modulation filter bank model combined with cross-correlation against the target representation. Our results also suggest that the modulation mistuning observed for the hearing-impaired group results primarily from broader cochlear filters. Yet, we find idiosyncratic behaviors that cannot be captured by cochlear tuning alone, highlighting the need to consider variability originating from additional mechanisms. Overall, this integrated experimental-computational approach offers a principled way to assess suprathreshold processing distortions in each individual and could thus be used to further investigate interindividual differences in speech intelligibility.},

These two aspects of behavior were estimated for normal-hearing participants using a constant-stimuli, forced-choice detection task repeated twice with the same stimuli (double pass). Sinusoidal AM or FM with rates of 2 or 20 Hz were applied to a 500-Hz pure-tone carrier and presented at detection threshold. All stimuli were masked by a modulation noise. Percent agreement of responses across passes and percent-correct detection for the two passes were used to estimate consistency and performance, respectively. These data were simulated using a model implementing peripheral processes, a central modulation ﬁlterbank, an additive internal noise, and a template-matching device. Different levels of internal noise were required to reproduce AM and FM data, but a single level could account for the 2- and 20-Hz AM data. As for FM, two levels of internal noise were needed to account for detection at slow and fast rates. Finally, the level of internal noise yielding best predictions increased with the level of the modulation-noise masker. Overall, these results suggest that different sources of internal variability are involved for AM and FM detection at low audio frequencies.},

The purpose of this study is to confirm the applicability and the sensibility of the “Reverse Correlation” task to right-hemisphere stroke patients, and to investigate links with other cognitive functions.
Methods : The “Reverse Correlation” task has been submitted to 13 right-hemisphere stroke patients whose stroke happened less than one year ago. Their results were compared with their performance in an auditory test, a depression screening’s scale, and with evaluations of other cognitive functions. The “Reverse Correlation” task has also been submitted to 12 healthy subjects.
Results : The patients’ mental representations of an interrogative intonation are different from healthy subjects’ ones. There are correlations between the “Reverse Correlation” task and depression on one hand, and auditory central processing on the other hand. There is no correlation between the task and auditory perception, music processing, attention in hearing modality, and another evaluation of prosodic perception.
Conclusion : This study suggests that the “Reverse Correlation” task is significant to evaluate linguistic perceptive prosody disorders with right-hemisphere stroke patients.},

Prosody is used to convey emotional connotation or linguistic intent and includes pitch, loudness, rate, and voice quality. A disorder in the comprehension or production of prosody is known as aprosodia; despite the communication disability caused by prosodic disorders, the assessment and treatment of aprosodia following ABI has received scant attention. Aims: The aim of this scoping review is to gather and synthesise useful knowledge on aprosodia and provide therapists with an exhaustive document in order to guide clinical decision-making encouraging active identification and treatment of this disorder.
Methods \& Procedures: This scoping review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines, investigated the existing literature concerning the assessment and treatments of linguistic and affective aprosodia in adult patients after ABI. A systematic search in four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, ScienceDirect) was conducted for articles written in English, French, or Italian published between 1970 and 2020. After all evaluative criteria were applied, 15 articles were included for final review. Outcomes \& Results: Results show the presence of six assessment tools for affective aprosodia and five evaluation tools targeting affective and linguistic prosody. Assessment of aprosodia is generally accomplished through acoustic and perceptual approaches. Current treatments for prosodic disorders focus on expressive aprosodia and have applied mostly two different approaches: imitative and cognitive–linguistic methods.
Conclusion \& Implications: Findings suggest that aprosodia can be assessed by therapists through various techniques and may be amenable to behavioural treatments. Nevertheless, although there are several assessment tools available, no one currently offers a comprehensive assessment that incorporates an ecological dimension. It therefore seems necessary to continue research in this direction. The rehabilitation of receptive prosody abilities also remains to be explored.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Poststroke depression (PSD) is a frequent complication of stroke with detrimental consequences in terms of quality of life and functional outcomes. In individuals with major depression, several studies have demonstrated an alteration of affective prosody. The aim of this study is to identify prosodic markers that may be predictive of PSD.
Methods—Patient voices were recorded at baseline and 3 months after stroke. We extracted prosodic parameters, including fundamental frequency, percentage of voice breaks, and shimmer. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed 3 months later.
Results—Among the 49 patients included in the study, 22.5\% developed PSD 3 months after stroke. A significant decrease was observed concerning the fundamental frequency among patients who developed PSD. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that initial voice breaks coupled with shimmer are strongly predictive of subsequent PSD.
Conclusions—Early alterations of affective prosody are associated with a higher risk of PSD 3 months after a stroke. This new physiological approach overcomes traditional barriers associated with clinical instruments and contributes to the prediction of this disorder.   (Stroke. 2016;47:2397-2400.

            The success of human cooperation crucially depends on mechanisms enabling individuals to detect unreliability in their conspecifics. Yet, how such epistemic vigilance is achieved from naturalistic sensory inputs remains unclear. Here we show that listeners’ perceptions of the certainty and honesty of other speakers from their speech are based on a common prosodic signature. Using a data-driven method, we separately decode the prosodic features driving listeners’ perceptions of a speaker’s certainty and honesty across pitch, duration and loudness. We find that these two kinds of judgments rely on a common prosodic signature that is perceived independently from individuals’ conceptual knowledge and native language. Finally, we show that listeners extract this prosodic signature automatically, and that this impacts the way they memorize spoken words. These findings shed light on a unique auditory adaptation that enables human listeners to quickly detect and react to unreliability during linguistic interactions.},

	abstract = {Performance in perceptual tasks often improves with practice. This effect is known as ‘perceptual learning,’ and it has been the source of a great deal of interest and debate over the course of the last century. Here, we consider the effects of perceptual learning within the context of signal detection theory. According to signal detection theory, the improvements that take place with perceptual learning can be due to increases in internal signal strength or decreases in internal noise. We used a combination of psychophysical techniques (external noise masking and double-pass response consistency) that involve corrupting stimuli with externally added noise to discriminate between the effects of changes in signal and noise as observers learned to identify sets of unfamiliar visual patterns. Although practice reduced thresholds by as much as a factor of 14, internal noise remained virtually ﬁxed throughout training, indicating learning served to predominantly increase the strength of the internal signal. We further examined the speciﬁc nature of the changes that took place in signal strength by correlating the externally added noise with observer’s decisions across trials (response classiﬁcation). This technique allowed us to visualize some of the changes that took place in the linear templates used by the observers as learning occurred, as well as test the predictions of a linear template-matching model. Taken together, the results of our experiments offer important new theoretical constraints on models of perceptual learning.},

We focus on social perception of faces, although the methods could be applied to other visual and nonvisual categories. We review two reverse correlation approaches: (a) psychophysical methods based on judgments of images altered with randomly generated noise, where the analysis relates the random variations of the images to judgments; and (b) methods based on judgments of randomly generated faces from a statistical, multidimensional face space model, where the analysis relates the dimensions of the face model to judgments.},

            Signal detection theory is a classic theory of perceptual decision making. This theory states that when people make a decision based on visual or auditory information, they calculate a “decision variable” that encodes their estimate of the probability of each possible response being correct. Until now, there has been no way to measure decision variables behaviorally. We describe a method of estimating decision variables, and we show that it is a highly effective way of revealing peoples’ decision strategies. This creates a new approach to answering long-standing questions about perception and decision making.
          , 
            Despite decades of research, there is still uncertainty about how people make simple decisions about perceptual stimuli. Most theories assume that perceptual decisions are based on decision variables, which are internal variables that encode task-relevant information. However, decision variables are usually considered to be theoretical constructs that cannot be measured directly, and this often makes it difficult to test theories of perceptual decision making. Here we show how to measure decision variables on individual trials, and we use these measurements to test theories of perceptual decision making more directly than has previously been possible. We measure classification images, which are estimates of templates that observers use to extract information from stimuli. We then calculate the dot product of these classification images with the stimuli to estimate observers' decision variables. Finally, we reconstruct each observer's “decision space,” a map that shows the probability of the observer’s responses for all values of the decision variables. We use this method to examine decision strategies in two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks, for which there are several competing models. In one experiment, the resulting decision spaces support the difference model, a classic theory of 2AFC decisions. In a second experiment, we find unexpected decision spaces that are not predicted by standard models of 2AFC decisions, and that suggest intrinsic uncertainty or soft thresholding. These experiments give new evidence regarding observers’ strategies in 2AFC tasks, and they show how measuring decision variables can answer long-standing questions about perceptual decision making.},

We then review many of the practical issues that arise when applying these methods to neurophysiological experiments: stimulus selection, behavioral control, model visualization, and validation. Finally we discuss several problems to which system identiﬁcation has been applied recently, including one important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience: developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.},

	abstract = {The decline of speech intelligibility in presbycusis can be regarded as resulting from the combined contribution of two main groups of factors: (1) audibility-related factors and (2) age-related factors. In particular, there is now an abundant scientific literature on the crucial role of suprathreshold auditory abilities and cognitive functions, which have been found to decline with age even in the absence of audiometric hearing loss. However, researchers investigating the direct effect of aging in presbycusis have to deal with the methodological issue that age and peripheral hearing loss covary to a large extent. In the present study, we analyzed a dataset of consonant-identification scores measured in quiet and in noise for a large cohort (
              n
              = 459, age = 42–92) of hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. HI listeners were provided with a frequency-dependent amplification adjusted to their audiometric profile. Their scores in the two conditions were predicted from their pure-tone average (PTA) and age, as well as from their Extended Speech Intelligibility Index (ESII), a measure of the impact of audibility loss on speech intelligibility. We relied on a causal-inference approach combined with Bayesian modeling to disentangle the direct causal effects of age and audibility on intelligibility from the indirect effect of age on hearing loss. The analysis revealed that the direct effect of PTA on HI intelligibility scores was 5 times higher than the effect of age. This overwhelming effect of PTA was not due to a residual audibility loss despite amplification, as confirmed by a ESII-based model. More plausibly, the marginal role of age could be a consequence of the relatively little cognitively-demanding task used in this study. Furthermore, the amount of variance in intelligibility scores was smaller for NH than HI listeners, even after accounting for age and audibility, reflecting the presence of additional suprathreshold deficits in the latter group. Although the non-sense-syllable materials and the particular amplification settings used in this study potentially restrict the generalization of the findings, we think that these promising results call for a wider use of causal-inference analysis in audiology, e.g., as a way to disentangle the influence of the various cognitive factors and suprathreshold deficits associated to presbycusis.},

	abstract = {In this review paper aimed at the non-specialist, we explore the use that neuroscientists and musicians have made of perceptual illusions based on ambiguity. The pivotal issue is auditory scene analysis (ASA), or what enables us to make sense of complex acoustic mixtures in order to follow, for instance, a single melody in the midst of an orchestra. In general, ASA uncovers the most likely physical causes that account for the waveform collected at the ears. However, the acoustical problem is ill-posed and it must be solved from noisy sensory input. Recently, the neural mechanisms implicated in the transformation of ambiguous sensory information into coherent auditory scenes have been investigated using so-called bistability illusions (where an unchanging ambiguous stimulus evokes a succession of distinct percepts in the mind of the listener). After reviewing some of those studies, we turn to music, which arguably provides some of the most complex acoustic scenes that a human listener will ever encounter. Interestingly, musicians will not always aim at making each physical source intelligible, but rather express one or more melodic lines with a small or large number of instruments. By means of a few musical illustrations and by using a computational model inspired by neuro-physiological principles, we suggest that this relies on a detailed (if perhaps implicit) knowledge of the rules of ASA and of its inherent ambiguity. We then put forward the opinion that some degree perceptual ambiguity may participate in our appreciation of music.},

	abstract = {Although there is a large consensus regarding the involvement of specific acoustic cues in speech perception, the precise mechanisms underlying the transformation from continuous acoustical properties into discrete perceptual units remains undetermined. This gap in knowledge is partially due to the lack of a turnkey solution for isolating critical speech cues from natural stimuli. In this paper, we describe a psychoacoustic imaging method known as the Auditory Classification Image technique that allows experimenters to estimate the relative importance of time-frequency regions in categorizing natural speech utterances in noise. Importantly, this technique enables the testing of hypotheses on the listening strategies of participants at the group level. We exemplify this approach by identifying the acoustic cues involved in da/ga categorization with two phonetic contexts, Al- or Ar-. The application of Auditory Classification Images to our group of 16 participants revealed significant critical regions on the second and third formant onsets, as predicted by the literature, as well as an unexpected temporal cue on the first formant. Finally, through a cluster-based nonparametric test, we demonstrate that this method is sufficiently sensitive to detect fine modifications of the classification strategies between different utterances of the same phoneme.},

We show mathematically that from the classification image of a noisy linear observer, it is possible to recover the observer’s absolute efficiency. If we could similarly predict human observers’ performance from their classification images, this would suggest that the linear model that underlies use of the classification image method is adequate over the small range of stimuli typically encountered in a classification image experiment, and that a classification image captures most important aspects of human observers’ performance over this range. In a contrast discrimination task and in a shape discrimination task, we found that observers’ absolute efficiencies were generally well predicted by their classification images, although consistently slightly ({\textasciitilde}13\%) higher than predicted. We consider whether a number of plausible nonlinearities can account for the slight under prediction, and of these we find that only a form of phase uncertainty can account for the discrepancy.},

Most research supports the dominant role of the right hemisphere in the control of emotional prosody. There has been signiﬁcant discussion of the participation of cortical and subcortical structures of the right hemisphere in the processing of various acoustic speech parameters. The aim of this study was an acoustic analysis of the speech parameters during emotional expression in right hemisphere ischemic strokes with an attempt to reference the results to lesion location. Materials and methods: Acoustic speech analysis was conducted on forty-six right-handed patients with right-middle cerebral artery stroke, together with 34 age-matched people in the control group. We compared the results of acoustic studies between patients with varying infarct locations and the control group.
Results: Variations in fundamental frequency during verbal expression of joy, anger and sadness were signiﬁcantly smaller in the patient group than in the control group. Cortical lesion caused more restrictions in fundamental frequency variation in the expression of joy and a lower voice intensity in expressions of anger and joy compared to those patients with subcortical lesions.
Conclusions: Cortical lesion was associated with a more impaired expression of emotional prosody than subcortical lesion. The results indicate the leading role of the cortical structures of the right hemisphere in the expression of emotional prosody.},

	abstract = {Impaired expression of emotion through pitch, loudness, rate, and rhythm of speech (affective prosody) is common and disabling after right hemisphere (RH) stroke. These deficits impede all social interactions. Previous studies have identified cortical areas associated with impairments of expression, recognition, or repetition of affective prosody, but have not identified critical white matter tracts. We hypothesized that: (1) differences across patients in specific acoustic features correlate with listener judgment of affective prosody and (2) these differences are associated with infarcts of specific RH gray and white matter regions. To test these hypotheses, 41 acute ischemic RH stroke patients had MRI diffusion weighted imaging and described a picture. Affective prosody of picture descriptions was rated by 21 healthy volunteers. We identified percent damage (lesion load) to each of seven regions of interest previously associated with expression of affective prosody and two control areas that have been associated with recognition but not expression of prosody. We identified acoustic features that correlated with listener ratings of prosody (hereafter “prosody acoustic measures”) with Spearman correlations and linear regression. We then identified demographic variables and brain regions where lesion load independently predicted the lowest quartile of each of the “prosody acoustic measures” using logistic regression. We found that listener ratings of prosody positively correlated with four acoustic measures. Furthermore, the lowest quartile of each of these four “prosody acoustic measures” was predicted by sex, age, lesion volume, and percent damage to the seven regions of interest. Lesion load in pars opercularis, supramarginal gyrus, or associated white matter tracts (and not control regions) predicted lowest quartile of the four “prosody acoustic measures” in logistic regression. Results indicate that listener perception of reduced affective prosody after RH stroke is due to reduction in specific acoustic features caused by infarct in right pars opercularis or supramarginal gyrus, or associated white matter tracts.},

	abstract = {Much of the debate surrounding the precise functional role of brain mechanisms implicated in the processing of human faces can be explained when considering that studies into early-stage neural representations of the spatial arrangement of facial features are potentially contaminated by “higher-level” cognitive attributes associated with human faces. One way to bypass such attributes would be to employ ambiguous stimuli that are not biased toward any particular object class and analyze neural activity in response to those stimuli in a manner similar to traditional reverse correlation for mapping visual receptive ﬁelds. Accordingly, we sought to derive whole face representations directly from neural activity in the human brain using electroencephalography (EEG). We presented ambiguous fractal noise stimuli to human participants and asked them to rate each stimulus along a “face not present” to “face present” continuum while simultaneously recording EEGs. All EEGs were subjected to a time–frequency analysis near 170 ms (negative amplitudes near 170 ms post-stimulus onset have been linked to early face processing) for ﬁve different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) on a trial-by-trial basis, independent of the behavioral responses. Images containing apparent face-like structure were obtained for theta through gamma frequency bands for strong negative amplitudes near 170 ms post-stimulus onset. The presence of the face-like structure in the spatial images derived from brain signals was objectively veriﬁed using both Fourier methods and trained neural networks. The results support the use of a modiﬁed reverse correlation technique with EEG as a nonbiased assessment of brain processes involved in the complex integration of spatial information into objects such as human faces.},

It is unclear, however, how to statistically quantify the amount of signal present in CIs, which limits the interpretability of these images. In this article, we propose a novel metric, infoVal, which assesses informational value relative to a resampled random distribution and can be interpreted like a z score. In the first part, we define the infoVal metric and show, through simulations, that it adheres to typical Type I error rates under various task conditions (internal validity). In the second part, we show that the metric correlates with markers of data quality in empirical reverse-correlation data, such as the subjective recognizability, objective discriminability, and test–retest reliability of the CIs (convergent validity). In the final part, we demonstrate how the infoVal metric can be used to compare the informational value of reverse-correlation datasets, by comparing data acquired online with data acquired in a controlled lab environment. We recommend a new standard of good practice in which researchers assess the infoVal scores of reverse-correlation data in order to ensure that they do not read signal in CIs where no signal is present. The infoVal metric is implemented in the open-source rcicr R package, to facilitate its adoption.},

            Visual functions decline with age, but how aging degrades visual functions remains controversial. In the current study, the mechanisms underlying age-related visual declines were examined psychophysically. We developed an efficient method to quickly explore contrast sensitivity as a function of nine spatial frequencies at three levels of external noise in both young and old subjects. Fifty-two young and twenty-six old subjects have been screened for ophthalmological and mental diseases and participated in the experiment. Contrast sensitivity varied significantly with spatial frequency, age, and level of external noise. By adopting a nonlinear observer model, we decomposed contrast sensitivity into inefficiencies in internal additive noise, internal multiplicative noise, perceptual template gain, and/or system non-linearity. Model analysis revealed that aging impacts both internal additive noise and perceptual template gain, and such age-related degradation is tuned to spatial frequency, which is also a good predictor to discriminate old from young. The quick characterization of contrast sensitivity functions at different noise levels and the accompanying analysis developed in the current study may have profound application in other clinical populations.},

This response variability can be used to estimate the amount of internal noise (i.e. noise that is not present in the stimulus but in the participant’s decision making process). The procedure by which the same set of stimuli is presented twice is referred to as double-pass (DP) methodology. This procedure is well-established, but there is no accepted recipe for how the repeated trials may be delivered (e.g. in the same order as they were originally presented, or in a different order); more importantly, it is not known whether the choice of delivery matters to the resulting estimates. Our results show that this factor (as well as feedback) has no measurable impact. We conclude that, for the purpose of estimating internal noise using the DP method, the system can be assumed to have no inter-trial memory.},

Although the right hemisphere is predominantly linked to the processing of affective prosodic cues, existing literature also suggests that damage to the left hemisphere can result in similar deﬁcits. This study aims to demonstrate, and add to the evidence, that patients with left-hemisphere injury experience difﬁculties with affective prosodic perception and production, measured via a new combination of assessments and analyses. It is also hypothesised that aphasia severity will be correlated with impaired processing of affective prosody.
Results: Stroke and control participants differed signiﬁcantly on prosody perception tests of matching auditory affective cues to visual images. Prosodic production was measured by participants vocalising different affective expressions of words and monosyllables – from which signiﬁcant differences were found in perceptual judgements of emotion accuracy and intensity, and acoustic analyses of pitch range and variance. There were signiﬁcant correlations between participants’ Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) scores, quality of life, and prosody production.
Conclusion: Individuals with left-hemisphere damage after stroke have impaired affective prosodic perception and production that may be associated with reduced quality of life. Ó 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we address these issues by investigating an extension of noise-based image classiﬁcation to BOLD responses recorded in high-level visual areas. First, we assess the applicability of this classiﬁcation method to such data and, second, we explore its results in connection with the neural processing of faces. To this end, we construct luminance templates from white noise ﬁelds based on the response of face-selective areas in the human ventral cortex. Using behaviorally and neurally-derived classiﬁcation images, our results reveal a family of simple but robust image structures subserving face representation and detection. Thus, we conﬁrm the role played by classical face selective regions in face detection and we help clarify the representational basis of this perceptual function. From a theory standpoint, our ﬁndings support the idea of simple but highly diagnostic neurally-coded features for face detection. At the same time, from a methodological perspective, our work demonstrates the ability of noisebased image classiﬁcation in conjunction with fMRI to help uncover the structure of high-level perceptual representations.

	abstract = {The reverse correlation (RC) is an innovative method to capture visual mental representations (i.e., classification images, CIs) of social targets that has become increasingly popular in social psychology. Because CIs of high quality are difficult to obtain without a large number of trials, the majority of past research relied on CIs extracted from samples of participants (average CIs). This strategy, however, leads to inflated false positivity rates. Using the representation from each participant (individual CIs) offers one solution to this problem. Still, this approach requires large numbers of trials and is thus economically costly, time demanding, demotivating for the participants, or simply impractical. We introduce a new version of the reverse correlation method, namely the Brief-RC. The Brief-RC increases the quality of individual (and average) CIs and reduces the overall task length by increasing the number of stimuli (i.e., noisy faces) presented at each trial. In two experiments, assessments by external judges confirm that the new method delivers equally good (Experiment 1) or higher-quality (Experiment 2) outcomes than the traditional method for the same number of trials, time length, and number of stimuli. The Brief-RC may thus facilitate the production of higher-quality individual CIs and alleviate the risk of false positivity rate.},

Importantly, the prior task experience, which the VGG-Face was pre-trained to process faces at the subordinate level (i.e., identiﬁcation) as humans do, seemed necessary for such representational similarity, because AlexNet, a DCNN pre-trained to process objects at the basic level (i.e., categorization), succeeded in gender classiﬁcation but relied on a completely different representation. In sum, although DCNNs and humans rely on different sets of hardware to process faces, they can use a similar and implementation-independent representation to achieve the same computation goal.},

Our review suggests that the technique is an invaluable tool in the investigation of social perception (e.g., in the perception of race, gender and personality traits), with ample potential applications. However, it is unclear how these visual proxies are best interpreted. Building on advances in cognitive neuroscience, we suggest that these proxies are visual reﬂections of the internal representations that determine how social stimuli are perceived.

	abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors may suffer from a range of hearing impairments that may restrict their participation in postacute rehabilitation programs. Hearing impairment may have a signiﬁcant impact on listening, linguistic skills, and overall communication of the affected stroke patient. However, no studies sought to systematically characterize auditory function of stroke patients in detail, to establish the different types of hearing impairments in this cohort of patients. Such information would be clinically useful in understanding and addressing the hearing needs of stroke survivors.
Purpose: The present study aimed to characterize and classify the hearing impairments, using a detailed audiological assessment test battery, in order to determine the level of clinical need and inform appropriate rehabilitation for this patient population. Research Design: A case–control study. Study Sample: Forty-two recruited stroke patients who were discharged from a stroke unit and 40 control participants matched for age. Data Collection and Analysis: All participants underwent pure-tone audiometry and immittance measurements including acoustic reﬂex threshold, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions, auditoryevoked brainstem response, and a central auditory processing assessment battery, performed in a single session. Hearing impairments were classiﬁed as peripheral hearing loss (cochlear and neural type), central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), and as a combination of CAPD and peripheral hearing loss.
Results: Overall mean hearing thresholds were not signiﬁcantly different between the control and stroke groups. The most common type of hearing impairment in stroke patients was the combination type, ‘‘peripheral and CAPD,’’ in the 61- to 80-yr-old subgroup (in 55\%), and auditory processing deﬁcits in 18- to 60-yr-olds (in 40\%), which were both signiﬁcantly higher than in controls.
Conclusions: This is the ﬁrst study to examine hearing function in detail in stroke patients. Given the importance of hearing for the efﬁciency of communication, it is essential to identify hearing impairments and differentiate peripheral and central deﬁcits to deﬁne an appropriate intervention plan.},

Internal noise has previously been estimated with the equivalent noise paradigm using broadband white noise masks and assuming a linear model. However, in addition to introducing noise into the detecting channel, white noise masks can suppress neural signals, and the linear model does not satisfactorily explain data from other paradigms. Here we propose estimating internal noise from a nonlinear gain control model ﬁtted to contrast discrimination data. This method, and noise estimates from the equivalent noise paradigm, are compared to a direct psychophysical measure of noise (double-pass consistency) using a detailed dataset with seven observers. Additionally, contrast discrimination and double-pass paradigms were further examined with a reﬁned set of conditions in 40 observers. We demonstrate that the gain control model produces more accurate double-pass consistency predictions than a linear model. We also show that the noise parameter is strongly related to consistency scores whereas the gain control parameter is not; a differentiation of which the equivalent noise paradigm is not capable. Lastly, we argue that both the contrast discrimination and the double-pass paradigms are sensitive measures of internal noise that can be used in the study of individual differences.},

	abstract = {Little is known about how older persons determine if someone deserves their trust or not based on their facial appearance, a process referred to as “facial trustworthiness.” In the past few years, Todorov and colleagues have argued that, in young adults, trustworthiness judgments are an extension of emotional judgments, and therefore, that trust judgments are made based on a continuum between anger and happiness (Todorov, 2008; Engell et al., 2010). Evidence from the literature on emotion processing suggest that older adults tend to be less efﬁcient than younger adults in the recognition of negative facial expressions (Calder et al., 2003; Firestone et al., 2007; Ruffman et al., 2008; Chaby and Narme, 2009). Based on Todorov’s theory and the fact that older adults seem to be less efﬁcient than younger adults in identifying emotional expressions, one could expect that older individuals would have different representations of trustworthy faces and that they would use different cues than younger adults in order to make such judgments. We veriﬁed this hypothesis using a variation of Mangini and Biederman’s (2004) reverse correlation method in order to test and compare classiﬁcation images resulting from trustworthiness (in the context of money investment), from happiness, and from anger judgments in two groups of participants: young adults and older healthy adults. Our results show that for elderly participants, both happy and angry representations are correlated with trustworthiness judgments. However, in young adults, trustworthiness judgments are mainly correlated with happiness representations. These results suggest that young and older adults differ in their way of judging trustworthiness.},

Over the last thirty years, these techniques have gained increasing popularity among both visual and auditory psychophysicists. However, thus far, principled applications of the psychophysical reverse-correlation approach have been almost exclusively limited to two-alternative decision (detection or discrimination) tasks. Whether and how reversecorrelation methods can be applied to uncover perceptual templates and decision strategies in situations involving more than just two response alternatives remains largely unclear. Here, the authors consider the problem of estimating perceptual templates and decision strategies in stimulus identification tasks with multiple response alternatives. They describe a modified correlational approach, which can be used to solve this problem. The approach is evaluated under a variety of simulated conditions, including different ratios of internal-to-external noise, different degrees of correlations between the sensory observations, and various statistical distributions of stimulus perturbations. The results indicate that the proposed approach is reasonably robust, suggesting that it could be used in future empirical studies.},

In addition, cells responsive to fast temporal frequencies predominated only in the field L input layer, suggesting that neurons with fast and slow responses are concentrated in different regions. Together with other songbird data and work from chicks and mammals, these findings suggest that sampling a range of temporal and spectral modulations, rather than orientation in time-frequency space, is the organizing principle of forebrain auditory sensitivity. We then examined the role of these acoustic parameters important to field L organization in a behavioral task. Birds’ categorization of songs fell off rapidly when songs were altered in frequency, but, despite the temporal sensitivity of field L neurons, the same birds generalized well to songs that were significantly changed in timing. These behavioral data point out that we cannot assume that animals use the information present in particular neurons without specifically testing perception.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In speech, social evaluations of a speaker’s dominance or trustworthiness are conveyed by distinguishing, but little-understood, pitch variations. This work describes how to combine state-of-the-art vocal pitch transformations with the psychophysical technique of reverse correlation and uses this methodology to uncover the prosodic prototypes that govern such social judgments in speech. This finding is of great significance, because the exact shape of these prototypes, and how they vary with sex, age, and culture, is virtually unknown, and because prototypes derived with the method can then be reapplied to arbitrary spoken utterances, thus providing a principled way to modulate personality impressions in speech.
          , 
            Human listeners excel at forming high-level social representations about each other, even from the briefest of utterances. In particular, pitch is widely recognized as the auditory dimension that conveys most of the information about a speaker’s traits, emotional states, and attitudes. While past research has primarily looked at the influence of mean pitch, almost nothing is known about how intonation patterns, i.e., finely tuned pitch trajectories around the mean, may determine social judgments in speech. Here, we introduce an experimental paradigm that combines state-of-the-art voice transformation algorithms with psychophysical reverse correlation and show that two of the most important dimensions of social judgments, a speaker’s perceived dominance and trustworthiness, are driven by robust and distinguishing pitch trajectories in short utterances like the word “Hello,” which remained remarkably stable whether male or female listeners judged male or female speakers. These findings reveal a unique communicative adaptation that enables listeners to infer social traits regardless of speakers’ physical characteristics, such as sex and mean pitch. By characterizing how any given individual’s mental representations may differ from this generic code, the method introduced here opens avenues to explore dysprosody and social-cognitive deficits in disorders like autism spectrum and schizophrenia. In addition, once derived experimentally, these prototypes can be applied to novel utterances, thus providing a principled way to modulate personality impressions in arbitrary speech signals.},

	title = {Encoding of vocal pitch in the dorsal premotor cortex during multi-talker speech recognition},
	url = {https://osf.io/kyxz7},
	abstract = {In a recent study (Venezia et al., 2021), left dorsal premotor cortex (dPM) responded to vocal pitch during a degraded speech recognition task, but only when speech was rated as unintelligible. Crucially, vocal pitch was not relevant to the task. The present fMRI study (N = 25) tests the hypothesis that left dPM will respond to vocal pitch for increasingly intelligible speech in a multi-talker speech recognition task that emphasizes pitch for talker segregation. We applied spectrotemporal modulation distortion to independently modulate vocal pitch and phonetic content in two-talker (male/female) utterances across two conditions (Competing, Unison), only one of which required pitch-based segregation (Competing). A Bayesian hierarchical drift-diffusion model (HDDM) was used to predict speech recognition performance (3-AFC response times, accuracy coded) from the pattern of spectrotemporal distortion imposed on each trial. The model’s drift rate parameter, a d’-like measure of speech recognition performance, was strongly associated with vocal pitch for Competing but not Unison. In a second, Bayesian hierarchical brain-behavior model, we then regressed the HDDM’s posterior predictions of trial-wise drift rate against trial-wise fMRI activation amplitude. A significant positive association with overall drift rate, reflecting contributions from vocal pitch and/or phonetic content, was observed in left dPM in both conditions. A significant positive association with ‘pitch-restricted’ drift rate, reflecting only contributions from vocal pitch, was observed in left dPM but only in the Competing condition. These findings suggest that left dPM: (i) responds to vocal pitch; and (ii) can operate in an auditory-pitch mode and a phonetic-speech mode.},

	abstract = {Two-choice response times are a common type of data, and much research has been devoted to the development of process models for such data. However, the practical application of these models is notoriously complicated, and ﬂexible methods are largely nonexistent. We combine a popular model for choice response times—the Wiener diffusion process—with techniques from psychometrics in order to construct a hierarchical diffusion model. Chief among these techniques is the application of random effects, with which we allow for unexplained variability among participants, items, or other experimental units. These techniques lead to a modeling framework that is highly ﬂexible and easy to work with. Among the many novel models this statistical framework provides are a multilevel diffusion model, regression diffusion models, and a large family of explanatory diffusion models. We provide examples and the necessary computer code.},

Experiment 1 showed that error responses speed up relative to correct responses under instructions to respond quickly. Experiment 2 showed that responses to less probable stimuli are slower and less accurate than responses to more probable stimuli. The data from both experiments support the diﬀusion model for lexical decision [Ratcliﬀ, R., Gomez, P., \& McKoon, G. (2004a). A diﬀusion model account of the lexical decision task. Psychological Review, 111, 159–182]. At the same time, the data provide evidence against the popular deadline model for lexical decision. The deadline model assumes that ‘‘nonword’’ responses are given only after the ‘‘word’’ response has timed out—consequently, the deadline model cannot account for the data from experimental conditions in which ‘‘nonword’’ responses are systematically faster than ‘‘word’’ responses.},

	abstract = {Existing data indicate that cortical speech processing is hierarchically organized. Numerous studies have shown that early auditory areas encode fine acoustic details while later areas encode abstracted speech patterns. However, it remains unclear precisely what speech information is encoded across these hierarchical levels. Estimation of speech-driven spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) provides a means to explore cortical speech processing in terms of acoustic or linguistic information associated with characteristic spectrotemporal patterns. Here, we estimate STRFs from cortical responses to continuous speech in fMRI. Using a novel approach based on filtering randomly-selected spectrotemporal modulations (STMs) from aurally-presented sentences, STRFs were estimated for a group of listeners and categorized using a data-driven clustering algorithm. ‘Behavioral STRFs’ highlighting STMs crucial for speech recognition were derived from intelligibility judgments. Clustering revealed that STRFs in the supratemporal plane represented a broad range of STMs, while STRFs in the lateral temporal lobe represented circumscribed STM patterns important to intelligibility. Detailed analysis recovered a bilateral organization with posterior-lateral regions preferentially processing STMs associated with phonological information and anterior-lateral regions preferentially processing STMs associated with word- and phrase-level information. Regions in lateral Heschl’s gyrus preferentially processed STMs associated with vocalic information (pitch).},

Here, we introduce the generalized drift-diffusion model (GDDM) framework for building and fitting DDM extensions, and provide a software package which implements the framework. The GDDM framework augments traditional DDM parameters through arbitrary userdefined functions. Models are solved numerically by directly solving the Fokker-Planck equation using efficient numerical methods, yielding a 100-fold or greater speedup over standard methodology. This speed allows GDDMs to be fit to data using maximum likelihood on the full response time (RT) distribution. We demonstrate fitting of GDDMs within our framework to both animal and human datasets from perceptual decision-making tasks, with better accuracy and fewer parameters than several DDMs implemented using the latest methodology, to test hypothesized decision-making mechanisms. Overall, our framework will allow for decision-making model innovation and novel experimental designs.},

	abstract = {Visual crowding refers to the marked inability to identify an otherwise perfectly identiﬁable object when it is ﬂanked by other objects. Crowding places a signiﬁcant limit on form vision in the visual periphery; its mechanism is, however, unknown. Building on the method of signal-clamped classiﬁcation images (Tjan \& Nandy, 2006), we developed a series of ﬁrst- and second-order classiﬁcation-image techniques to investigate the nature of crowding without presupposing any model of crowding. Using an ‘‘o’’ versus ‘‘x’’ letter-identiﬁcation task, we found that (1) crowding signiﬁcantly reduced the contrast of ﬁrst-order classiﬁcation images, although it did not alter the shape of the classiﬁcation images; (2) response errors during crowding were strongly correlated with the spatial structures of the ﬂankers that resembled those of the erroneously perceived targets; (3) crowding had no systematic effect on intrinsic spatial uncertainty of an observer nor did it suppress feature detection; and (4) analysis of the second-order classiﬁcation images revealed that crowding reduced the amount of valid features used by the visual system and, at the same time, increased the amount of invalid features used. Our ﬁndings strongly support the feature-mislocalization or source-confusion hypothesis as one of the proximal contributors of crowding. Our data also agree with the inappropriate feature-integration account with the requirement that feature integration be a competitive process. However, the feature-masking account and a front-end version of the spatial attention account of crowding are not supported by our data.},

The usual analysis strategy is fundamentally identical across these contexts – it amounts to calculating the average value of the high-dimensional variable for each value of the categorical variable, and comparing these results by subtraction. Though intuitive and straightforward, this procedure may be inaccurate or inefficient, and may overlook important detail. Sophisticated approaches have been developed within these several experimental contexts, but they are rarely applied beyond the context in which they were developed. Recognition of the relationships among these contexts has the potential to accelerate improvements in analytic methods and to increase the information that can be gleaned from experiments.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Limited research has been conducted with the aim of understanding which upper extremity movements are difﬁcult for persons with severe chronic stroke. The purpose of this study was to test the structure of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) using Rasch analysis in persons with chronic stroke with moderate to severe deﬁcits and to determine the item difﬁculty hierarchy. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from previous randomized, controlled trials, or clinical trials. The participants were 101 persons with chronic stroke with moderate to severe hemiparesis (time after onset of stroke, 1375.3 ± 1157.9 days; the 33-item FMA-UE, 31.1 ± 12.8). Principal component analysis and inﬁt statistics were used to evaluate dimensionality. Rasch analysis using a rating scale model was performed, and item difﬁculty was determined. Results: Six misﬁt items were removed. The results showed that the 27-item FMA-UE was unidimensional. Rasch analysis showed that the movements performed within synergies were among the easiest items. Shoulder and elbow movements were among the easiest items, whereas forearm and wrist movements were among the moderately to most difﬁcult items. Hand items spanned various difﬁculty levels. Discussion and Conclusions: The FMA-UE is a valid assessment tool of upper extremity motor function in persons with chronic stroke with moderate to severe deﬁcits. The results showed that item difﬁculty was consistent with the stepwise recovery course proposed by Fugl-Meyer. The movements that are difﬁcult for patients with moderate to severe chronic paresis were determined, which would enable comparison of each movement using a measure of motion difﬁculty in future studies.},

	abstract = {Empirical work and models of visual word recognition have traditionally focused on group-level performance. Despite the emphasis on the prototypical reader, there is clear evidence that variation in reading skill modulates word recognition performance. In the present study, we examined differences between individuals who contributed to the English Lexicon Project (http://elexicon.wustl.edu), an online behavioral database containing nearly four million word recognition (speeded pronunciation and lexical decision) trials from over 1,200 participants. We observed considerable within- and between-session reliability across distinct sets of items, in terms of overall mean response time (RT), RT distributional characteristics, diffusion model parameters (Ratcliff, Gomez, \& McKoon, 2004), and sensitivity to underlying lexical dimensions. This indicates reliably detectable individual differences in word recognition performance. In addition, higher vocabulary knowledge was associated with faster, more accurate word recognition performance, attenuated sensitivity to stimuli characteristics, and more efficient accumulation of information. Finally, in contrast to suggestions in the literature, we did not find evidence that individuals were trading-off in their utilization of lexical and nonlexical information.},

Since realworld optimization problems are costly and have no speciﬁc mathematical formula, Bayesian optimization (BO) is frequently used to optimize these black-box expensive functions. Typically, a total budget is assigned for BO to ﬁnd the optimal solution, but how to eﬃciently use the given budget has not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we propose a single-objective cost-aware BO framework to eﬃciently optimize an expensive black-box function with regard to the budget. Our proposed method utilizes a multi-armed bandit algorithm to quickly ﬁgure out a suitable strategy to deal with the cost of the optimization problem. It is ﬂexible in adapting to diﬀerent types of optimum-cost relations, extendable to multiple strategies, and simple to implement. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world optimization problems to demonstrate the advantages of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other cost-aware BO methods.},

	abstract = {Objective: To identify which aspects of prosody are negatively affected subsequent to right hemisphere brain damage (RHD) and to evaluate the methodological quality of the constituent studies. Method: Twenty-one electronic databases were searched to identify articles from 1970 to February 2020 by entering keywords. Eligibility criteria for articles included a focus on adults with acquired RHD, prosody as the primary research topic, and publication in a peerreviewed journal. A quality appraisal was conducted using a rubric adapted from Downs and Black (1998). Results: Of the 113 articles appraised as eligible and appropriate for inclusion, 71 articles were selected to undergo data extraction for both meta-analyses of population effect size estimates and qualitative synthesis. Across all domains of prosody, the effect estimate was g = 2.51 [95\% CI (1.94, 3.09), t = 8.66, p {\textless} 0.0001], based on 129 contrasts between RHD and non-brain-damaged healthy controls (NBD), indicating a significant random effects model. This effect size was driven by findings in emotional prosody, g = 2.48 [95\% CI (1.76, 3.20), t = 6.88, p {\textless} 0.0001]. Overall, studies of higher quality (rpb = 0.18, p {\textless} 0.001) and higher sample size/contrast ratio (rpb = 0.25, p {\textless} 0.001) were more likely to report significant differences between RHD and NBD participants. Conclusions: The results confirm consistent evidence for emotional prosody deficits in the RHD population. Inconsistent evidence was observed across linguistic prosody domains and pervasive methodological issues were identified across studies, regardless of their prosody focus. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous and sufficiently high-powered designs to examine prosody subsequent to RHD, particularly within the linguistic prosody domain.},

            Aphasia is an acquired impairment in the production or comprehension of language, typically caused by left hemisphere stroke. The subtyping framework used in clinical aphasiology today is based on the Wernicke-Lichtheim model of aphasia formulated in the late 19th century, which emphasizes the distinction between language production and comprehension. The current study used a data-driven approach that combined modern statistical, machine learning, and neuroimaging tools to examine behavioural deficit profiles and their lesion correlates and predictors in a large cohort of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. First, individuals with aphasia were clustered based on their behavioural deficit profiles using community detection analysis (CDA) and these clusters were compared with the traditional aphasia subtypes. Random forest classifiers were built to evaluate how well individual lesion profiles predict cluster membership. The results of the CDA analyses did not align with the traditional model of aphasia in either behavioural or neuroanatomical patterns. Instead, the results suggested that the primary distinction in aphasia (after severity) is between phonological and semantic processing rather than between production and comprehension. Further, lesion-based classification reached 75\% accuracy for the CDA-based categories and only 60\% for categories based on the traditional fluent/non-fluent aphasia distinction. The results of this study provide a data-driven basis for a new approach to classification of post-stroke aphasia subtypes in both research and clinical settings.},

These parameters in various combinations signal linguistic, emotional-attitudinal, and personal identity information. Prosodic processing engages cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, and brainstem systems, and damage to any of these can result in dysprosody. Despite the crucial role played by prosody in communication, little attention has been paid to clinical evaluation and even less to treatment. Numerous research studies of deficient emotional prosodic production and recognition reveal temporal deficits in association with left hemisphere damage and pitch processing failure in right hemisphere damage. Limited attempts at linguistic-prosodic testing suggest that damage to either cerebral hemisphere or to subcortical systems can affect production as well as comprehension. Treatment of linguistic dysprosody has revealed challenges in protocol design and performance evaluation. Prosodic insufficiency, present in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar disease, has substantial implications for communicative function and deserves to be a strong focus of future research.},

Among the most often used methods are explicit reports of subjective confidence, post-decision wagering and measuring additional info-seeking behavior. While all three methods are thought to measure confidence, they differ greatly in terms of practical execution and theoretical foundation. The method of reverse correlation has previously been used to determine which aspects of the stimulus influence decisions and confidence judgments. Here we compare the three methods of confidence assessment using reverse correlation analysis. Explicit reports and post-decision wagering revealed a positive association of stimulus information with choices and reduced decision weights for low-confidence trials. When confidence was assessed using the info-seeking method, low-confidence trials showed an inverted association with primary stimulus information. Using modelling of the behavioral data, we show how the reverse correlation results of all three methods can be explained by a simple model of confidence when internal error-corrections are allowed during seeking of additional information.},

	abstract = {Background: It is estimated that approximately 50\% of individuals who incur righthemisphere damage (RHD) have subsequent communication disorders. Lexicalsemantic, discourse, prosodic, and pragmatic deficits have been reported following RHD, but the co-occurrence of these deficits within the same individual has not yet been systematically investigated. Therefore clinical profiles of communication impairments in individuals with RHD still have to be identified and described in order to appreciate their communication impairment and provide strategies for rehabilitation. Aims: The goal of the present study was to explore the clinical profiles of communication impairments subsequent to a right hemisphere lesion.
Methods and Procedures: A total of 28 French-speaking individuals with a righthemisphere lesion were evaluated using the Protocole MEC (Joanette, Ska, \& Coˆ te´, 2004), a normalised battery allowing the assessment of communication deficits after RHD. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to group participants according to similarities in their results on the 14 tasks. Outcomes and Results: Four subgroups of RHD individuals were identified on the basis of the overall similarities of performance on the 14 tasks of the Protocole MEC. Participants in the first cluster showed impairments in all four language components evaluated, whereas the second cluster of participants was also impaired in prosodic, lexical-semantic, and pragmatic abilities, but was characterised by a relative preservation of discourse abilities. The third cluster of participants did not show any abnormal results. Finally, two individuals were mainly characterised by some lexicalsemantic deficits.
Conclusions: The Protocole MEC used in conjunction with a cluster analysis provided a first step towards the identification of communication impairment profiles among the population of individuals with RHD. In the present study it was not possible to clearly identify the relationship between a given profile and factors such as lesion site, age, or},

The aim of this book is to give a short but mathematically self-contained introduction to the theory of nonparametric estimation. The emphasis is on the construction of optimal estimators; therefore the concepts of minimax optimality and adaptivity, as well as the oracle approach, occupy the central place in the book." "This is a concise text developed from lecture notes and ready to be used for a course on the graduate level. The main idea is to introduce the fundamental concepts of the theory while maintaining the exposition suitable for a first approach in the field. Therefore, the results are not always given in the most general form but rather under assumptions that lead to shorter or more elegant proofs." "The book has three chapters. Chapter 1 presents basic nonparametric regression and density estimators and analyzes their properties. Chapter 2 is devoted to a detailed treatment of minimax lower bounds. Chapter 3 develops more advanced topics: Pinsker's theorem, oracle inequalities, Stein shrinkage, and sharp minimax adaptivity."--Jacket},

	shorttitle = {Psychoacoustics},
	abstract = {Psychoacoustics: Perception of Normal and Impaired Hearing with Audiology Applications provides an overview of the field of psychoacoustics, with a primary focus on auditory perception. The influence of hearing loss on these general auditory abilities is discussed in every chapter. Components of the book also include the role of psychoacoustics in audiological assessment and treatment. Psychoacoustics is ideal for graduate students in audiology who intend on having a clinical career and need an understanding of both normal and impaired auditory perception. It is intended to give students sufficient information to understand how the ear achieves auditory perception, what the capabilities of the ear are, and how hearing loss influences that perception. It also provides students with a foundation for further study in the area and to apply psychoacoustic principles to diagnostic audiology and audiological rehabilitation. Each chapter presents self-contained information related to the acoustics, physiology, and methodologies as they apply to the topic being discussed. Chapters include the following: introduction, relevant acoustics, important physiological studies, perception by normal-hearing listeners, and perception by listeners who have sensorineural hearing loss. The final chapter discusses clinical implications of deficits in perceptual abilities by listeners with sensorineural hearing loss. Because psychoacoustics is intimately integrated into clinical audiology, this chapter also includes a discussion of many of the clinical tests and practices that have evolved directly from psychoacoustic experimentation. Key Features: Learning objectives and summaries begin and end each chapter to convey the goals of the text and review student comprehension. Each chapter contains exercises designed to develop critical thinking about psychoacoustics. The text emphasizes applied learning for more effective and efficient learning of the material. Ancillaries include PowerPoint lecture slides, and lab exercises and demonstrations so that students may develop their understanding of psychoacoustic topics and instructors can facilitate that learning},

Whilst LMMs offer a ﬂexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the ﬁtting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Amusics have problems with musical melody perception, yet early work suggested that they had no problems with the perception of speech intonation (Ayotte, Peretz, \& Hyde, 2002). However, here we show that about 30\% of amusics from independent studies (British and French-Canadian) have difficulty discriminating a statement from a question on the basis of a final pitch fall or rise. This suggests that pitch direction perception deficits in amusia (known from previous psychophysical work) can extend to speech. For British amusics, the direction deficit is related to the rate of change of the final pitch glide in statements/ questions, with increased discrimination difficulty when rates are relatively slow. These findings suggest that amusia provides a useful window on the neural relations between melodic processing in language and music.},

The WHO definition of stroke was used. Register data served to analyze educational level. A total of 457 first-ever strokes (244 women and 213 men) were registered, corresponding to an overall annual incidence rate of first-ever stroke of 413.4 per 100,000. The incidence of first-ever stroke was significantly higher among low-educated compared to high-educated men and women. The highest stroke incidence was found among low-educated women aged 75–85 years. The educational-related differences in stroke incidence persisted in the oldest age group (75–85 years), also after controlling for sex and age. This is one of the first studies that analyzes first-ever stroke incidence also among elderly men and women (75–85 years) in relation to socioeconomic status. More community-based studies are needed in order to confirm the results.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the use of P-values and the terms “signiﬁcant”, “non-signiﬁcant” and “suggestive” in Abstracts in the European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head \& Neck Diseases. Materials and methods: Consecutive articles accepted for publication during the period January 2016 –February 2019 were systematically reviewed. Main goal: descriptive analysis of the citation of P-values and use of the terms “signiﬁcant”, “non-signiﬁcant” and “suggestive” in Abstracts. Secondary goal: analytic study of: (i) correlations between citation of a P-value and the main characteristics of authors and topics; and (ii) misuse of the terms “signiﬁcant”, “non-signiﬁcant” and “suggestive” with respect to cited P-values, and correlations with author and topic characteristics.
Results: In all, 91 articles were included. P-values and the terms “signiﬁcant”, “non-signiﬁcant” and “suggestive” were cited in 35.1\%, 41.7\%, 10.9\% and 0\% of Abstracts, respectively. Citing a P-value did not signiﬁcantly correlate with author or topic characteristics. There were discrepancies between the terms “non-signiﬁcant”, “signiﬁcant” and “suggestive” and P-values given in the body of the article in 57.1\% of Abstracts, with 30.7\% overestimation and 25.2\% underestimation of results, without signiﬁcant correlation with author or topic characteristics.
Conclusion: Authors, editors and reviewers must pay particular attention to the spin resulting from inappropriate use of the terms “signiﬁcant”, “non-signiﬁcant” and “suggestive” in Abstracts of articles submitted to the European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head \& Neck Diseases, to improve the rigor, quality and value of the scientiﬁc message delivered to the reader.},

The emergence of cognitive ﬂexibility is dependent on two kinds of interactions: the interaction of several cognitive mechanisms, and the interaction of sensorimotor mechanisms, cognition, and context in developmental time. The quest for a comprehensive and uniﬁed account of cognitive ﬂexibility is highly justiﬁed given its potential usefulness in fostering efﬁcient problem solving and creativity.},

	abstract = {Disorders of music and speech perception, known as amusia and aphasia, have traditionally been regarded as dissociated deﬁcits based on studies of brain damaged patients. This has been taken as evidence that music and speech are perceived by largely separate and independent networks in the brain. However, recent studies of congenital amusia have broadened this view by showing that the deﬁcit is associated with problems in perceiving speech prosody, especially intonation and emotional prosody. In the present study the association between the perception of music and speech prosody was investigated with healthy Finnish adults (n = 61) using an on-line music perception test including the Scale subtest of Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) and Off-Beat and Out-of-key tasks as well as a prosodic verbal task that measures the perception of word stress. Regression analyses showed that there was a clear association between prosody perception and music perception, especially in the domain of rhythm perception. This association was evident after controlling for music education, age, pitch perception, visuospatial perception, and working memory. Pitch perception was signiﬁcantly associated with music perception but not with prosody perception. The association between music perception and visuospatial perception (measured using analogous tasks) was less clear. Overall, the pattern of results indicates that there is a robust link between music and speech perception and that this link can be mediated by rhythmic cues (time and stress).},

              Objective
              : Social cognition has received growing interest in many conditions in recent years. However, this construct still suffers from a considerable lack of consensus, especially regarding the dimensions to be studied and the resulting methodology of clinical assessment. Our review aims to clarify the distinctiveness of the dimensions of social cognition.
              Method
              : Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements, a systematic review was conducted to explore the factor structure of social cognition in the adult general and clinical populations.
              Results
              : The initial search provided 441 articles published between January 1982 and March 2017. Eleven studies were included, all conducted in psychiatric populations and/or healthy participants. Most studies were in favor of a two-factor solution. Four studies drew a distinction between low-level (e.g., facial emotion/prosody recognition) and high-level (e.g., theory of mind) information processing. Four others reported a distinction between affective (e.g., facial emotion/prosody recognition) and cognitive (e.g., false beliefs) information processing. Interestingly, attributional style was frequently reported as an additional separate factor of social cognition.
              Conclusions
              : Results of factor analyses add further support for the relevance of models differentiating level of information processing (low-
              vs
              . high-level) from nature of processed information (affective
              vs
              . cognitive). These results add to a significant body of empirical evidence from developmental, clinical research and neuroimaging studies. We argue the relevance of integrating low-
              versus
              high-level processing with affective and cognitive processing in a two-dimensional model of social cognition that would be useful for future research and clinical practice. (

On the basis of a set of pre-established clinical questions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and search parameters, studies investigating sentence- or discourse-level treatments were identified and evaluated for methodological quality. Data regarding participant, intervention, and outcome variables were reported. Results: Only 5 studies were identified, each representing a different sentence- or discourse-level treatment approach and reporting a wide range of prosodic, expressive, receptive, and pragmatic outcomes. Conclusion: Although the state of the evidence pertaining to right hemisphere communication treatments is at a very preliminary stage, some positive findings were identified to assist speech-language pathologists who are working with individuals with right hemisphere brain damage.

	abstract = {Objective: To review the frequency, clinical correlates, and mechanism of anosognosia after stroke.
Methods: We searched the most recent relevant literature on anosognosia after stroke and carried out a critical analysis of the main findings.
Results: Anosognosia is present in about 10\% of acute stroke patients and its diagnosis is relatively simple. Nevertheless, a valid and reliable standardization of diagnostic instruments and criteria for research purposes is more difficult to achieve. This limitation may partially account for various instruments available to assess anosognosia and the different strategies used to diagnose this phenomenon. Anosognosia is a fleeting phenomenon and chronic cases are infrequent. There is a robust association between anosognosia and right-hemisphere lesions involving cortical (insular, temporal, and parietal lobes) and subcortical structures (thalamus and basal ganglia). The main clinical correlates of anosognosia are the presence of neglect, cognitive deficits, previous strokes, and older age. Anosognosia has a negative impact on the rehabilitation of stroke patients. The mechanism of anosognosia remains unknown but was explained as owing to psychological denial, disconnexion between left and right hemispheres, and dysfunction of a system that monitors the intention to move and actual movements.
Conclusion: Anosognosia is a relatively frequent complication of acute stroke and may become an excellent model to understand the mechanism of human awareness. Can J Psychiatry. 2010;55(6):355–361.},

Methods—We conducted a systematic review of the excess risk of incident dementia conferred by stroke. Studies of the risk of incident dementia in the population with stroke compared with the population without stroke were identified and compared.
Results—Sixteen studies were identified with all but one conducted in a community setting. A history of stroke doubles the risk of incident dementia in the older population. This increase is not explained by demographic or cardiovascular risk factors or by prestroke cognitive decline. The excess risk of incident dementia diminishes with time after stroke and may be higher in those without an APOE ⑀4 allele. There is no excess risk of incident dementia in those aged Ͼ85 years with a history of stroke compared to those aged Ͼ85 years without stroke.
Conclusions—The effect of stroke on dementia incidence in the population is not explained by common risk factors. At this time of population aging and increased stroke survival, more research is needed to determine to what extent efforts to reduce the incidence of stroke will affect the incidence of dementia.

Five women and nine men with expressive aprosodia following right-hemisphere brain damage received the treatments in two phases 1 month apart in random order. Treatment was received 3 to 4 days a week for a total of 20 sessions each phase. As the outcome measure, sentences that elicited treated (happy, angry, sad, neutral) and untreated (fear) emotional tones of voice were administered during baseline, prior to treatment sessions, following treatment termination, and at 1- and 3-month followups. Effect sizes indicated that treatment effects were modest to substantial and that 12 participants responded to at least one treatment. Four responsive participants who were available for follow-up showed benefit at 1 and 3 months posttreatment. Most visual and statistical analyses were congruent.},

Factors in the perception of prosodic disorder are discussed, including the relationship between prosody and other aspects of communication, to identify the problems of distinguishing between prosody and interacting factors. The relationship between phonological prosodic categories and disordered prosody is considered, i.e., the problems of assigning disordered prosody to these categories for clinicians. Current methods of assessment, transcription and approaches to treatment are brieﬂy considered, and an evaluation is made of how much progress has been made towards answering the initial question.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research suggests that musical training has a beneﬁcial impact on speech processing (e.g., hearing of speech in noise and prosody perception). As this research moves forward two key questions need to be addressed: 1) Can purely instrumental musical training have such effects? 2) If so, how and why would such effects occur? The current paper offers a conceptual framework for understanding such effects based on mechanisms of neural plasticity. The expanded OPERA hypothesis proposes that when music and speech share sensory or cognitive processing mechanisms in the brain, and music places higher demands on these mechanisms than speech does, this sets the stage for musical training to enhance speech processing. When these higher demands are combined with the emotional rewards of music, the frequent repetition that musical training engenders, and the focused attention that it requires, neural plasticity is activated and makes lasting changes in brain structure and function which impact speech processing. Initial data from a new study motivated by the OPERA hypothesis is presented, focusing on the impact of musical training on speech perception in cochlear-implant users. Suggestions for the development of animal models to test OPERA are also presented, to help motivate neurophysiological studies of how auditory training using non-biological sounds can impact the brain’s perceptual processing of species-speciﬁc vocalizations.},

Several criteria have been proposed, such as adaptations of the deviance information criterion, marginal likelihoods, Bayes factors, and reversible jump MCMC techniques. It was recently shown that in overfitted mixture models, the overfitted latent classes will asymptotically become empty under specific conditions for the prior of the class proportions. This result may be used to construct a criterion for finding the true number of latent classes, based on the removal of latent classes that have negligible proportions. Unlike some alternative criteria, this criterion can easily be implemented in complex statistical models such as latent class mixed-effects models and multivariate mixture models using standard Bayesian software. We performed an extensive simulation study to develop practical guidelines to determine the appropriate number of latent classes based on the posterior distribution of the class proportions, and to compare this criterion with alternative criteria. The performance of the proposed criterion is illustrated using a data set of repeatedly measured hemoglobin values of blood donors.},

If the class membership of the outcomes is known, ROC can be constructed for a model, and the ROC with greater area under the curve indicates better performance. However in practice, imperfect reference standards often exist, in which class membership of every data point is not fully determined. This situation is especially prevalent in highthroughput biomedical data because obtaining perfect reference standards for all data points is either too costly or technically impractical. To construct ROC curves for these data, the common practice is to either ignore the uncertainties in references or remove data points with high uncertainties. Such approaches may cause bias to the ROC curves and generate misleading results in method evaluation. Here we present a framework to incorporate membership uncertainties into the construction of ROC curve, termed the expected ROC or “eROC” curve. We develop an efﬁcient procedure for the estimation of eROC curve. The advantages of using eROC are demonstrated using simulated and real data.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effects of two mechanism-based treatments for expressive aprosodia. Three participants, two women and one man, had a right hemisphere cerebral infarction resulting in affective aprosodia with greater expressive than receptive deficits. Trained raters determined presence of aprosodia by judging participants’ performance on two emotional communication batteries. A single-subject design with replication across three participants was employed. Sentence production with the use of treated and nontreated emotions was measured during baseline and treatment phases. Sentences were scored for accuracy by a trained rater blind to time of testing and analyzed visually and statistically. Effect sizes calculated on the resulting data for each participant and treatment confirmed modest to substantial treatment effects for both treatments in all three participants. Because of a relative paucity of treatment studies investigating expressive aprosodia, these data are among the first to suggest that aprosodia may be amenable to behavioral treatments.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Approximately one fourth of strokes occur in people aged Ͻ65 years. UK current policy calls for services that meet the specific needs of working-aged adults with stroke. We aimed to identify the social consequences of stroke in working-aged adults, which might subsequently inform the development and evaluation of services for this group.
Methods—We reviewed quantitative and qualitative studies identifying social consequences for working-aged adults with stroke using multiple search strategies (electronic databases, bibliographic references, hand searches). Social consequences were defined as those pertaining to the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health domain “participation.” Two authors reviewed articles using a standardized matrix for data extraction.
Results—Seventy-eight studies were included: 66 were quantitative observational studies, 2 were quantitative interventional studies, 9 were qualitative studies, and one used mixed methods. Seventy studies reported data on return to work after stroke with proportions ranging from 0\% to 100\%. Other categories of social consequences included negative impact on family relationships (5\% to 54\%), deterioration in sexual life (5\% to 76\%), economic difficulties (24\% to 33\%), and deterioration in leisure activities (15\% to 79\%).
Conclusions—Methodological variations account for the wide range of rates of return to work after stroke. There is limited evidence of the negative impact of stroke on other aspects of social participation. Robust estimates of the prevalence of such outcomes are required to inform the development of appropriate interventions. We propose strategies by which methodology and reporting in this field might be improved. (Stroke. 2009;40:e431-e440.)},

	abstract = {Background: While the negative impact of aphasia has been the focus of much research, few studies have investigated more positive examples of people living with aphasia. Exploring the concept of living successfully with aphasia from an insider perspective can enhance current research by providing positively framed data that balance this negative skew. Collectively, the perspectives of people with aphasia on themes of importance for living successfully with aphasia may inform clinical interventions and other communitybased services, enabling positive adaptive factors and processes identified in the research to be promoted and ultimately improving the quality of life for people with aphasia. Aims: The aim of this study was to explore, from the perspectives of people with aphasia, the meaning of living successfully with aphasia.
Methods \& Procedures: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 participants with aphasia. All participants had aphasia as a result of stroke, lived in the community, and were at least 2 years post-stroke. As an adjunct to the interview process participants were asked to take photographs of what living successfully with aphasia meant to them. These photographs formed the basis of discussion for a second interview. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (Smith, Jarman, \& Osborn, 1999). Outcomes \& Results: Analysis of participant transcripts revealed that the concept of living successfully with aphasia is complex, and highly individualised. Four core themes related to living successfully with aphasia emerged from the data: doing things; meaningful relationships; striving for a positive way of life; and communication.
Conclusions: Research focusing on living successfully with aphasia challenges researchers and clinicians to focus on positive adaptive processes and factors. Further research is indicated to develop the concept of living successfully with aphasia further and explore how best to work in partnership with individuals with aphasia to ensure their priorities for living with aphasia are addressed.},

            We created a digital audio platform to covertly modify the emotional tone of participants’ voices while they talked toward happiness, sadness, or fear. Independent listeners perceived the transformations as natural examples of emotional speech, but the participants remained unaware of the manipulation, indicating that we are not continuously monitoring our own emotional signals. Instead, as a consequence of listening to their altered voices, the emotional state of the participants changed in congruence with the emotion portrayed. This result is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of peripheral feedback on emotional experience in the auditory domain. This finding is of great significance, because the mechanisms behind the production of vocal emotion are virtually unknown.
          , 
            Research has shown that people often exert control over their emotions. By modulating expressions, reappraising feelings, and redirecting attention, they can regulate their emotional experience. These findings have contributed to a blurring of the traditional boundaries between cognitive and emotional processes, and it has been suggested that emotional signals are produced in a goal-directed way and monitored for errors like other intentional actions. However, this interesting possibility has never been experimentally tested. To this end, we created a digital audio platform to covertly modify the emotional tone of participants’ voices while they talked in the direction of happiness, sadness, or fear. The result showed that the audio transformations were being perceived as natural examples of the intended emotions, but the great majority of the participants, nevertheless, remained unaware that their own voices were being manipulated. This finding indicates that people are not continuously monitoring their own voice to make sure that it meets a predetermined emotional target. Instead, as a consequence of listening to their altered voices, the emotional state of the participants changed in congruence with the emotion portrayed, which was measured by both self-report and skin conductance level. This change is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of peripheral feedback effects on emotional experience in the auditory domain. As such, our result reinforces the wider framework of self-perception theory: that we often use the same inferential strategies to understand ourselves as those that we use to understand others.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine whether right ventral stream and limbic structures (including posterior superior temporal gyrus [STG], STG, temporal pole, inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, anterior cingulate, gyrus, and the sagittal stratum) are implicated in emotional prosody identiﬁcation.
Methods Patients with MRI scans within 48 hours of unilateral right hemisphere ischemic stroke were enrolled. Participants were presented with 24 sentences with neutral semantic content spoken with happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised, or bored prosody and chose which emotion the speaker was feeling based on tone of voice. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify individual predictors of emotional prosody identiﬁcation accuracy from a model, including percent damage to proposed right hemisphere structures, age, education, and lesion volume across all emotions (overall emotion identiﬁcation) and 6 individual emotions. Patterns of recovery were also examined at the chronic stage.
Results The overall emotion identiﬁcation model was signiﬁcant (adjusted r2 = 0.52; p = 0.043); greater damage to right posterior STG (p = 0.038) and older age (p = 0.009) were individual predictors of impairment. The model for recognition of fear was also signiﬁcant (adjusted r2 = 0.77; p = 0.002), with greater damage to right amygdala (p = 0.047), older age (p {\textless} 0.001), and less education (p = 0.005) as individual predictors. Over half of patients with chronic stroke had residual impairments.
Conclusions Right posterior STG in the right hemisphere ventral stream is critical for emotion identiﬁcation in speech. Patients with stroke with damage to this area should be assessed for emotion identiﬁcation impairment.},

	abstract = {The present investigation focussed on the neural substrates underlying linguistic distinctions that are signalled by prosodic cues. A production experiment was conducted to examine the ability of left- (LHD) and right- (RHD) hemisphere-damaged patients and normal controls to use temporal and fundamental frequency cues to disambiguate sentences which include one or more Intonational Phrase level prosodic boundaries. Acoustic analyses of subjects’ productions of three sentence types—parentheticals, appositives, and tags—showed that LHD speakers, compared to RHD and normal controls, exhibited impairments in the control of temporal parameters signalling phrase boundaries, including inconsistent patterns of pre-boundary lengthening and longer-than-normal pause durations in non-boundary positions. Somewhat surprisingly, a perception test presented to a group of normal native listeners showed listeners experienced greatest diYculty in identifying the presence or absence of boundaries in the productions of the RHD speakers. The Wndings support a cue lateralization hypothesis in which prosodic domain plays an important role.},

	abstract = {In a series of decisions, people tend to show choice perseveration, that is, they repeat their choices. This choice perseveration is assumed to emerge due to residual activity from the previous decision. Here, we use a computational model with attractor dynamics to describe this process and to predict how choice perseveration can be modulated. We derive two qualitative predictions: Choice perseveration should decrease under longer (vs. shorter) inter-trial intervals and positive (vs. negative) mood. We test these predictions in a dynamic decision task where we modulate decisions across trials via sequentially manipulated reward options. Our ﬁndings replicate our previous study in showing choice perseveration in value-based decision making. Furthermore, choice perseveration decreased with increasing inter-trial interval as predicted by the model. However, we did not ﬁnd clear evidence supporting mood eﬀects on choice perseveration. We discuss how integrating decision process dynamics by the means of applying the neural attractor model can increase our understanding of the evolution of decision outcomes and therefore complement the psychophysical perspective on decision making.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Measures of brain activation (e.g., changes in scalp electrical potentials) have become the most popular method for inferring brain function. However, examining brain disruption (e.g., examining behavior after brain injury) can complement activation studies. Activation techniques identify regions involved with a task, whereas disruption techniques are able to discover which regions are crucial for a task. Voxel-based lesion mapping can be used to determine relationships between behavioral measures and the location of brain injury, revealing the function of brain regions. Lesion mapping can also correlate the effectiveness of neurosurgery with the location of brain resection, identifying optimal surgical targets. Traditionally, voxel-based lesion mapping has employed the chi-square test when the clinical measure is binomial and the Student's t test when measures are continuous. Here we suggest that the Liebermeister approach for binomial data is more sensitive than the chi-square test. We also suggest that a test described by Brunner and Munzel is more appropriate than the t test for nonbinomial data because clinical and neuropsychological data often violate the assumptions of the t test. We test our hypotheses comparing statistical tests using both simulated data and data obtained from a sample of stroke patients with disturbed spatial perception. We also developed software to implement these tests (MRIcron), made freely available to the scientific community.},

	abstract = {Introduction – In France, stroke is the first cause of death in women, and the third in men. The age-standardized rates of patients hospitalized for stroke increased in patients younger than 65 years between 2002 and 2008. After the implementation of the “National Stroke Action Plan” (2010-2014), this study analyzed trends in the rates of patients hospitalized for stroke and of patients hospitalized in stroke units since 2008.
Methods – Data came from the French national hospital discharge databases (PMSI-MCO, 2008-2014). For each patient, the first annual hospitalization for stroke was selected. Crude hospitalized patients and in-hospital mortality rates were calculated by stroke subtypes, age group and sex, and then were age-standardized. Time trends were tested using a Poisson regression model.
Results – In 2014, 110,438 patients were hospitalized for stroke. The proportion of patients hospitalized in a stroke unit was 51.5\% for ischemic stroke (IS) and 33.2\% for intracerebral hemorrhage. From 2008 to 2014, the age-standardized rate of patients hospitalized for IS increased by 14.3\% in patients aged less than 65 years, and decreased by 2.1\% in those aged 65 and over. In contrast, for hemorrhagic stroke, the rate barely changed (+2.0\%). During the same period, in-hospital mortality decreased by 12.5\% in IS patients. Important regional disparities were observed in the rates of patients hospitalized for stroke.
Conclusion – The encouraging increase in the proportion of patients hospitalized in stroke units and the decrease in in-hospital mortality should not hide three major observations: the stabilization of the rates of ­hospitalized patients for stroke (overall) in a context of population aging, the increase in patients hospitalized rates for IS in young adults, and important regional disparities in patients hospitalized rates.},

The aim of the present study was to assess the potential deﬁcits of auditory short-term memory for verbal and musical material after stroke and their underlying cerebral correlates with a Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping approach (VLSM). Patients with an ischemic stroke in the right (N = 10) or left (N = 10) middle cerebral artery territory and matched control participants (N = 14) were tested with a detailed neuropsychological assessment including global cognitive functions, music perception and language tasks. All participants then performed verbal and musical auditory short-term memory (STM) tasks that were implemented in the same way for both materials. Participants had to indicate whether series of four words or four tones presented in pairs, were the same or different. To detect domain-general STM deﬁcits, they also had to perform a visual STM task. Behavioral results showed that patients had lower performance for the STM tasks in comparison with control participants, regardless of the material (words, tones, visual) and the lesion side. The individual patient data showed a double dissociation between some patients exhibiting verbal deﬁcits without musical deﬁcits or the reverse. Exploratory VLSM analyses suggested that dorsal pathways are involved in verbal (phonetic), musical (melodic), and visual STM, while the ventral auditory pathway is involved in musical STM.},

	abstract = {Intonational meaning is located in two components of language, the phonetic implementation and the intonational grammar. The phonetic implementation is widely used for the expression of universal meanings that derive from ‘biological codes’, meaning dimensions based on aspects of the production process of pitch variation. Three codes are identified, Ohala’s Frequency Code, the Effort Code and the Production Code. In each case, ‘informational’ meanings (which relate to the message) are identified, while for the first two codes also ‘affective’ meanings (relating to the state of the speaker) are discussed. Speech communities will vary in the extent to which they employ those meanings, and in the choices they make when they conflict. What they will never do, however, is change the natural form-function relations that they embody. By contrast, grammaticalised meanings often mimic the natural meanings, but linguistic change may create quite arbitrary form-meaning relations when forms are phonologised, and the semantics is systematised. English grammaticalised intonational meaning concerns information status.},

	abstract = {Neglect patients' performance during cancellation tasks is characterized by left sided omissions and, in many cases, by the production of inappropriate material of various kinds in the ipsilesional space, e.g. additional marks over already cancelled targets, marks drawn away from targets, scribbles, irrelevant drawings. It is unclear whether these behaviours, which have collectively been called perseverative, are functionally and anatomically connected and whether they correlate with the severity of neglect. Here we report a retrospective study on 33 right brain damaged patients with neglect after right hemisphere lesions in whom we measured the intensity of perseveration of the three following kinds: (1) ‘additional marks' (AM) perseveration where patients cancelled a target with two or more well separated marks; (2) ‘scribble’ perseveration, where patients, instead of cancelling the target with a single pen stroke as required by the task, performed multiple pen strokes without breaking the pen-to-paper contact, with the ﬁnal product being a scribble; (3) ‘ﬂying marks’ (FM) perseveration where patients produced cancellation marks well away from the targets. We found that AM and FM perseveration correlated with neglect severity, while ‘scribble’ perseveration did not. The lesion-symptom mapping showed three separate anatomical areas in the right hemisphere: ‘scribble’ perseveration was associated with lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus; AM perseveration was associated with damage to the rolandic operculum, superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus; FM perseveration was associated with damage to the dorsal premotor cortex and the temporal pole. Neglect severity followed damage to a region which grossly corresponds to the sum of the regions associated with AM and FM perseveration respectively. This complex behavioural and anatomical pattern is interpreted in terms of a three-factor model, in which AM perseveration is caused by a deﬁcit of disengagement of attention from the right side (also causing omissions), FM perseveration is caused by directional hypokinesia (also causing left-side omissions), and ‘scribble’ perseveration is the consequence of a failure to inhibit an initiated motor act, which is completely separate (both anatomically and functionally) from the disorder inducing omissions.},

We identified four cognitive functions considered crucial for spoken language production: semantic-to-lexical mapping (selecting the appropriate lexical label for the intended concept); phonological encoding (retrieving the word’s phonological form); articulatory-motor planning (programming the articulatory motor movements); and goal-driven language selection (exerting top-down control over the words selected for production). Each participant received a score estimating their competence on each function. We then mapped the region(s) where pathology was significantly associated with low scores. For semantic-to-lexical mapping, the critical map encompassed portions of the left posterior middle and inferior temporal gyri, extending into posterior fusiform gyrus, overlapping substantially with the territory of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. For phonological encoding, the map encompassed the left inferior parietal lobe and posterior middle temporal gyrus, overlapping with the territory of the inferior longitudinal and posterior arcuate fasciculi. For articulatory-motor planning, the map encompassed parts of the left frontal pole, frontal operculum, and inferior frontal gyrus, and overlapped with the territory of the frontal aslant tract. Finally, the map for goal-driven language selection encompassed the left frontal pole and the anterior cingulate cortex. We compare our findings with those from other neuropsychological samples, and conclude that the study of tumour patients offers evidence that complements that available from other populations.},

	abstract = {Background: Aphasia severity is known to affect quality of life (QoL) in stroke patients, as is mood disorders, functional limitations, limitations on activities of daily life, economic status and level of education. However, communication limitation or fatigue has not been explored in this speciﬁc population.
Objective: We aimed to investigate whether these factors were associated with QoL in patients with aphasia after stroke.
Methods: Patients with aphasia were included from April 2014 to November 2017 after a ﬁrst stroke and were followed for 2 years post-stroke. QoL was assessed at follow-up by the French Sickness Impact Proﬁle 65 (SIP-65). We explored predictors such as mood disorders, communication impairment, fatigue, limitations on activities of daily life, and aphasia severity in addition to socio-demographic factors.
Results: We included 32 individuals (22 men; mean age 60.7 [SD 16.6] years) with aphasia after a ﬁrst stroke. Poor QoL as assessed by the SIP-65 was signiﬁcantly associated (Pearson correlations) with increased severity of aphasia initially (P = 0.008) and at follow-up (P = 0.01); increased communication activity limitations at follow-up (P {\textless} 0.001); increased limitations on activities of daily life at baseline (P = 0.008) and follow-up (P {\textless} 0.001); increased fatigue at follow-up (P = 0.001); and increased depression symptoms at follow-up (P = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, QoL was associated with communication activity limitations, limitations on activities of daily life, fatigue and depression, explaining more than 75\% of the variance (linear regression R2 = 0.756, P {\textless} 0.001). The relative importance in predicting the variance was 32\% for limitations on activities of daily life, 21\% fatigue, 23\% depression and 24\% communication activity limitations.
Conclusion: Aphasia severity, mood disorders and functional limitations may have a negative effect on QoL in patients with aphasia. Also, for the ﬁrst time, we show that fatigue has an important impact on QoL in this population. Speciﬁc management of this symptom might be beneﬁcial and should be explored in future studies.},

	abstract = {Pitch is used to signal different aspects of language such as speaker identity, intonation, emphatic stress, and word identity (as signaled by lexical tones). This article reviews research studies investigating hemispheric specialization of these pitch patterns in the context of two competing hypotheses. The functional hypothesis states that pitch patterns are lateralized to different hemispheres of the brain depending on their functions. Those pitch patterns that carry a greater linguistic load (e.g., lexical tones) are lateralized to the left hemisphere, while those that carry a less linguistic load (e.g., intonation patterns signaling affective moods) are lateralized to the right hemisphere. The alternative hypothesis, the acoustic hypothesis, states that all pitch patterns, regardless of their functions, are lateralized to one hemisphere (the right hemisphere in particular). Although most researchers support the functional hypothesis, a comprehensive review, which includes lesion, dichotic-listening, and functional imaging studies of different types of pitch patterns, does not support this view. Moreover, little evidence exists for the alternative hypothesis. Possible methodological problems of these studies, alternative hypotheses, and considerations for future research are noted. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

So far, little is known about the relationship between cognitive and affective deficits in major depression. In the present investigation, affect perception and executive functions were assessed in 29 patients with a diagnosis of major depression (Dep) and 29 healthy controls (HC). Both groups were comparable on IQ, age, and gender distribution. Depressed patients showed deficits of perception of affective prosody, which were significantly related to inhibition, set shifting, and working memory. Our findings suggest a significant association between cognitive deficits and affect perception impairments in major depression, which may be of considerable clinical relevance and might be addressed in treatment approaches. Future studies are desirable to investigate the nature of the association in more detail. (

	abstract = {Our vocal tone—the prosody—contributes a lot to the meaning of speech beyond the actual words. Indeed, the hesitant tone of a ‘‘yes’’ may be more telling than its afﬁrmative lexical meaning [1]. The human brain contains dorsal and ventral processing streams in the left hemisphere that underlie core linguistic abilities such as phonology, syntax, and semantics [2–4]. Whether or not prosody—a reportedly right-hemispheric faculty [5, 6]—involves analogous processing streams is a matter of debate. Functional connectivity studies on prosody leave no doubt about the existence of such streams [7, 8], but opinions diverge on whether information travels along dorsal [9] or ventral [10, 11] pathways. Here we show, with a novel paradigm using audio morphing combined with multimodal neuroimaging and brain stimulation, that prosody perception takes dual routes along dorsal and ventral pathways in the right hemisphere. In experiment 1, categorization of speech stimuli that gradually varied in their prosodic pitch contour (between statement and question) involved (1) an auditory ventral pathway along the superior temporal lobe and (2) auditory-motor dorsal pathways connecting posterior temporal and inferior frontal/premotor areas. In experiment 2, inhibitory stimulation of right premotor cortex as a key node of the dorsal stream decreased participants’ performance in prosody categorization, arguing for a motor involvement in prosody perception. These data draw a dual-stream picture of prosodic processing that parallels the established left-hemispheric multistream architecture of language, but with relative rightward asymmetry.},

            An emerging hypothesis postulates that internal noise is a key factor influencing perceptual abilities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given fundamental and inescapable effects of noise on nearly all aspects of neural processing, this could be a critical abnormality with broad implications for perception, behavior, and cognition. However, this proposal has been challenged by both theoretical and empirical studies. A crucial question is whether and how internal noise limits perception in ASD, independently from other sources of perceptual inefficiency, such as the ability to filter out external noise. Here, we separately estimated internal noise and external noise filtering in ASD. In children and adolescents with and without ASD, we computationally modeled individuals’ visual orientation discrimination in the presence of varying levels of external noise. The results revealed increased internal noise and worse external noise filtering in individuals with ASD. For both factors, we also observed high inter-individual variability in ASD, with only the internal noise estimates significantly correlating with severity of ASD symptoms. We provide evidence for reduced perceptual efficiency in ASD that is due to both increased internal noise and worse external noise filtering, while highlighting internal noise as a possible contributing factor to variability in ASD symptoms.},

The cognitive-communication disorder (CCD) found following a right hemisphere stroke has been less extensively researched with rehabilitation access and outcomes yet to be determined.
Objectives: To document rehabilitation access and outcomes for people with CCD post-stroke; and compare outcomes based on presence (viz CCD; aphasia) or absence of communication impairment.
Methods: A retrospective chart audit was completed for patients with first onset unilateral stroke, with a hospital length of stay (LOS) of at least two days and a communication assessment by a speech pathologist. Data extracted included presence and severity of communication impairment, access to and LOS in a rehabilitation unit, and functional outcome measures recorded at rehabilitation discharge.
Results: The majority of the 115 patients who met inclusion criteria were living independently (n = 112, 97.4\%) at the time of stroke. CCD (66\%) was diagnosed with similar frequency to aphasia (68\%). The presence of communication impairment did not result in significant differences in rehabilitation LOS and discharge destination when compared to hemispheric strokes without communication impairment. Severity of CCD was an independent predictor of functional gain by rehabilitation discharge.
Conclusions: People with CCD require comparable access to rehabilitation as people with aphasia, and severity of CCD should be considered in determining rehabilitation LOS. A large number of people are discharged with ongoing CCD which warrants exploration of potential participation restrictions created by the communication impairment.},

	abstract = {Background Approximately 15 million people who suffer a stroke globally each year are at risk of developing depression. Aim To update our systematic review and meta-analysis of the frequency of depression after stroke published in 2005, including studies published before July 2004.
Methods We included all published observational studies (to 31 May 2013) with prospective consecutive recruitment and quantiﬁcation of the proportion of people with depression after stroke. We included studies of adult ({\textgreater}18 years) patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, where an assessment of depression or depressive symptom burden was performed at a pre-speciﬁed time-point for all study participants.
Results Data were available from 61 studies including 25 488 people. The proportional frequency of depression varied considerably across studies; however, the pooled frequency estimate of 31\% (95\% conﬁdence interval 28\% to 35\%) was not signiﬁcantly different from the 33\% (difference of 2\%, 95\% conﬁdence interval {\textless}1\% to 3\%) reported in the 2005 review. The proportion with depression between one and ﬁve-years (25\%; 95\% conﬁdence interval 16 to 33\%) and at ﬁve years after stroke (23\%; 95\% conﬁdence interval 14 to 31\%) was signiﬁcantly lower.
Conclusion Despite systematic review evidence describing validated depression screening tools and effective treatment and prevention strategies for depression after stroke, there has not been a signiﬁcant reduction in the proportion of people experiencing depression after stroke. There is a pressing need for increased clinical uptake of evidenced-based strategies to screen for, prevent, and treat depression after stroke.},

We calculated classification images (CIs) by averaging all selected images. Trait judgments of independent participants, as well as objective metrics, showed that the CIs visualized the intended traits well. Furthermore, tests of pixel clusters showed that diagnostic information resided mostly in mouth, eye, eyebrow, and hair regions.

The first part of this paper, under the heading « background », explicits the reasons for the popular role currently played by prosody within speech sciences and related domains. We then propose a set of remarks about the status of phonology, its relations with phonetics, and the consequences of these relations on prosodic analysis. The second part falls into two phases: first, we focus on the formal architecture of prosody, its substance, the place it holds within the linguistic system, and terminological considerations; we then emphasize the inherent difficulty of prosodic analysis, in relation with the articulation not only of substance and form, but also of substance, form and function. The third part presents current linguistic approaches to prosody (traditional linear, multilinear, metrical and autosegmental). Finally, this presentation discusses the concepts of constituency and prosodic domains, together with their psychological validity, in the light of recent psycholinguistic research on production and perception processes.},

	abstract = {The study objective was to better understand the clinical and social characteristics, and the treatment plans, of brain-damaged patients who were hospitalized longer than one month in acute care units. A 6-month descriptive prospective epidemiological study of 90 patients was carried out. The average length of stay (LOS) was 84 ± 73 days. Patients were severely disabled: 17.83 \% of patients showed a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 2, 70\% a GOS 3 and 12.2 \%, a GOS ≥ 4. Two-thirds of the patients had social difficulties that influenced their LOS (68.4 days when social difficulties {\textless}3, versus 157.4 days when ≥ 3). An average of 4 rehabilitation settings were solicited per patient. The actual rehabilitation setting matched the patient’s and team’s wishes in only 63.4 \% of the cases. Several proposals are discussed to improve overall management of care for brain-damaged patients: the need to establish a mobile steering team, to improve multidisciplinary approaches, and to create acute physical medicine and rehabilitation units.},

A number of authors have claimed that speciﬁc intonation patterns reﬂect speciﬁc emotions, whereas others have found little evidence supporting this claim and argued that F0/pitch and other vocal aspects are continuously, rather than categorically, aﬀected by emotions and/or emotional arousal. In this contribution, a new coding system for the assessment of F0 contours in emotion portrayals is presented. Results obtained for actor portrayed emotional expressions show that mean level and range of F0 in the contours vary strongly as a function of the degree of activation of the portrayed emotions. In contrast, there was comparatively little evidence for qualitatively diﬀerent contour shapes for diﬀerent emotions.},

Furthermore, neurobiological and paleoanthropological data point at a two-stage model of the phylogenetic evolution of this crucial prerequisite of spoken language: (i) monosynaptic reﬁnement of the projections of motor cortex to the brainstem nuclei that steer laryngeal muscles, presumably, as part of a “phylogenetic trend” associated with increasing brain size during hominin evolution; (ii) subsequent vocal-laryngeal elaboration of cortico-basal ganglia circuitries, driven by human-speciﬁc FOXP2 mutations.},

All participants met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) at week one. Using both perceptual judgments by naive listeners and quantitative analyses of vocal timing and fundamental frequency, three hypotheses were tested: 1) Naive listeners can perceive the severity of depression from vocal recordings of depressed participants and interviewers. 2) Quantitative features of vocal prosody in depressed participants reveal change in symptom severity over the course of depression. 3) Interpersonal effects occur as well; such that vocal prosody in interviewers shows corresponding effects. These hypotheses were strongly supported. Together, participants’ and interviewers’ vocal prosody accounted for about 60 percent of variation in depression scores, and detected ordinal range of depression severity (low, mild, and moderate-to-severe) in 69 percent of cases (kappa ¼ 0:53). These findings suggest that analysis of vocal prosody could be a powerful tool to assist in depression screening and monitoring over the course of depressive disorder and recovery.},

The prosodic components of speech assist in inferring the attitude and emotion of the speaker and are vital in everyday communication. A review of the literature suggests that the left hemisphere is responsible for modulating the linguistic components of prosody (e.g., timing), whereas the right hemisphere is predominantly responsible for modulating the affective components of prosody (e.g., spectral information or pitch). Disorders of affective aprosodia have been classified along the same dimensions as the aphasias. Bedside evaluation and neuroimaging have been used to identify and classify types of aprosodia. The treatment goals for aphasia may be adapted and applied to aprosodia. Additionally, pharmacotherapy and biofeedback have been found useful in the treatment of aprosodia and associated features.},

However, medical research studies sometimes report statistical analysis that is either inappropriate or insufficient to attest to the accuracy and validity of findings and conclusions. Published works involving inaccurate statistical analyses and insufficient reporting influence the conduct of future scientific studies, including meta-­analyses and medical decisions. Although the biostatistical practice has been improved over the years due to the involvement of statistical reviewers and collaborators in research studies, there remain areas of improvement for transparent reporting of the statistical analysis section in a study. Evidence-b­ ased biostatistics practice throughout the research is useful for generating reliable data and translating meaningful data to meaningful interpretation and decisions in medical research. Most existing research reporting guidelines do not provide guidance for reporting methods in the statistical analysis section that helps in evaluating the quality of findings and data interpretation. In this report, we highlight the global and critical steps to be reported in the statistical analysis of grants and research articles. We provide clarity and the importance of understanding study objective types, data generation process, effect size use, evidence-­based biostatistical methods use, and development of statistical models through several thematic frameworks. We also provide published examples of adherence or non-­adherence to methodological standards related to each step in the statistical analysis and their implications. We believe the suggestions provided in this report can have far-­reaching implications for education and strengthening the quality of statistical reporting and biostatistical practice in medical research.},

Computational modeling of covert cognitive processes supporting cognitive ﬂexibility may provide progress toward nosologically speciﬁc aspects of cognitive inﬂexibility. We review computational models of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which represents a gold standard for the clinical assessment of cognitive ﬂexibility. A parallel reinforcement-learning (RL) model provides the best conceptualization of individual trial-by-trial WCST responses among all models considered. Clinical applications of the parallel RL model suggest that patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) share a non-speciﬁc covert cognitive symptom: bradyphrenia. Impaired stimulus-response learning appears to occur speciﬁcally in patients with PD, whereas haphazard responding seems to occur speciﬁcally in patients with ALS. Computational modeling hence possesses the potential to reveal nosologically speciﬁc proﬁles of covert cognitive symptoms, which remain undetectable by traditionally applied behavioral methods. The present review exempliﬁes how computational neuropsychology may advance the assessment of cognitive ﬂexibility. We discuss implications for neuropsychological assessment and directions for future research.},

Here we use a ‘gold standard’ psychophysical double-pass paradigm to investigate the relationship between internal noise and autistic traits in the neurotypical population (n=43). We measured internal noise in three tasks (contrast perception, facial expression intensity perception and number summation) to estimate a global internal noise factor using principal components analysis. This global internal noise was positively correlated with autistic traits (rs=0.32, p=0.035). This suggests that increased internal noise is associated with the ASD phenotype even in subclinical populations. The finding is discussed in relation to the neural and genetic basis of internal noise in ASD.},

This hypothesis is supported by the results of a production experiment. Experimental evidence shows significant prosodic differences between syntactically similar information-seeking questions and surprise questions.

	abstract = {Objective. Brains, like other physical devices, are inherently noisy. This source of variability is large, to the extent that internal noise often impacts human sensory processing more than externally induced (stimulus-driven) perturbations. Despite the fundamental nature of this phenomenon, its statistical distribution remains unknown: for the past 40 years it has been assumed Gaussian, but the applicability (or lack thereof) of this assumption has not been checked. Approach. We obtained detailed measurements of this process by exploiting an integrated approach that combines experimental, theoretical and computational tools from bioengineering applications of system identiﬁcation and reverse correlation methodologies. Main results. The resulting characterization reveals that the underlying distribution is in fact not Gaussian, but well captured by the Laplace (double-exponential) distribution. Signiﬁcance. Potentially relevant to this result is the observation that image contrast follows leptokurtic distributions in natural scenes, suggesting that the properties of internal noise in human sensors may reﬂect environmental statistics.},

	abstract = {The optimal template for signal detection in white additive noise is the signal itself: the ideal observer matches each stimulus against this template and selects the stimulus associated with largest match. In the noisy ideal observer, internal noise is added to the decision variable returned by the template. While the ideal observer represents an unrealistic approximation to the human visual process, the noisy ideal observer may be applicable under certain experimental conditions. For template values constrained to lie within a specified range, theory predicts that the template associated with a noisy ideal observer should be a clipped image of the signal, a result which we demonstrate analytically using variational calculus. It is currently unknown whether the human process conforms to theory. We report a targeted analysis of the theoretical prediction for an experimental protocol that maximizes template-matching on the part of human participants. We find indicative evidence to support the theoretical expectation when internal noise is compared across participants, but not within each participant. Our results indicate that implicit knowledge about internal variability in different individuals is reflected by their detection templates; no implicit knowledge is retained for internal-noise fluctuations experienced by a given participant during data collection. The results also indicate that template encoding is constrained by the dynamic range of weight specification, rather than the range of output values transduced by the template-matching process.},

In6estigati6e Ophthalmology and Visual Science, 38, S687; Lu, Z.-L., \& Dosher, B. (1998). Vision Research, 38, 1183–1198), increasing amounts of external noise (white Gaussian random noise) is added to the visual stimulus in order to identify mechanisms of perceptual learning. Performance improved (threshold contrast was reduced) over days of practice on a peripheral orientation discrimination task — labelling Gabor patches as tilted slightly to the right or left. Practice improvements were largely speciﬁc to the trained quadrant of the display. Performance improved at all levels of external noise. The external noise method and perceptual template model (PTM) of the observer identiﬁes the mechanism(s) of performance improvements as due to stimulus enhancement, external noise exclusion, or internal noise suppression. The external noise method was further extended by measuring thresholds at two threshold performance levels, allowing identiﬁcation of mixtures in the PTM model. Perceptual learning over 8 – 10 days improved the ﬁltering or exclusion of external noise by a factor of two or more, and improved suppression of additive internal noise — equivalent to stimulus enhancement — by 50\% or more. Coupled improvements in external noise exclusion and stimulus enhancement in the PTM model may reﬂect channel weighting. Perceptual learning may not reﬂect neural plasticity at the level of basic visual channels, nor cognitive adjustments of strategy, but rather plasticity at an intermediate level of weighting inputs to decision. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Ensemble statistics of a visual scene can be estimated to provide a gist of the scene without detailed analysis of all individual items. The simplest and most widely studied ensemble statistic is mean estimation, which requires averaging an ensemble of elements. Averaging is useful to estimate the mean of an ensemble and discard the variance. The source of variance can be external (i.e., variance across the physical elements) or internal (i.e., imprecisions in the estimates of the elements by the visual system). The equivalent noise paradigm is often used to measure the impact of the internal variance (i.e., the equivalent input noise). This paradigm relies on the assumption that the averaging process is equally effective independently of the main source of variance, internal or external, so any difference between the processing when the main source of variance is internal or external must be assumed not to affect the averaging efficiency. The current fMRI study compared the neural activity when the main variance is caused by the stimulus (i.e., high variance) and when it is caused by imprecisions in the estimates of the elements by the visual system (i.e., low variance). The results showed that the right superior frontal and left middle frontal gyri can be significantly more activated when the variance in the orientation of the Gabors was high than when it was low. Consequently, the use of the equivalent noise paradigm requires the assumption that such additional neural activity in high variance does not affect the averaging efficiency.},

Observers estimated the mean direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise of vertical) of a ﬁeld of moving band-pass elements whose directions were drawn from a wrapped normal distribution. By measuring discrimination thresholds for mean direction as a function of directional variance, we were able to infer both the precision of observersÕ representation of each elementÕs direction (i.e., local noise) as well as how many of these estimates they were averaging (i.e., global pooling). We estimated EN for various numbers of moving elements occupying regions of various sizes. We report that both local and global limits on direction integration are determined by the number of elements present in the display (irrespective of their density or the size of region they occupy), and we go on to show how this dependence can be understood in terms of neural noise. Speciﬁcally, we use Monte Carlo simulations to show that a maximum-likelihood operator, operating on pooled directional signals from visual cortex corrupted by Poisson noise, accounts for psychophysical data across all conditions tested, as well as motion coherence thresholds (collected under similar experimental conditions). A population vector-averaging scheme (essentially a special case of ML estimation) produces similar predictions but out-performs subjects at high levels of directional variability and fails to predict motion coherence thresholds.},

A research method of self-psychological three executive controls and creativity generation for creation in multimusic environment is proposed. A computer composition algorithm is based on the hidden Markov model and interactive genetic algorithm. By integrating melody elements and rhythm into the traditional Markov model with only notes or rhythm as the unit, a new hidden Markov music prediction model is established, and the interactive genetic algorithm is used to optimize the music segments. Simulation results show that the algorithm can use a small dataset to quickly create music clips with certain melody logic and in line with users’ personality. It is proved that the method based on the hidden Markov model and interactive genetic algorithm can meet the research needs of self-psychological three execution control and creativity generation in multimusic environment.},

In essence, it is simply a more sophisticated version of what humans have done since time immemorial: noticed and reﬂected upon what we can see, hear, and feel. In the 21st century, when hugely powerful techniques are available that enable us to probe the innermost structure and function of nervous systems, is human psychophysics still relevant? I argue that it is, and that in combination with other techniques, it will continue to be a key part of neuroscience for the foreseeable future. I discuss these points in detail using the example of binocular stereopsis, where human psychophysics in combination with physiology and computational vision, has made a substantial contribution.},

In particular, I show how the bias-variance tradeoff from machine learning can be formally generalized to be applicable to several prominent educational debates, including debates around learning theories (cognitivist vs. situativist and constructivist theories) and pedagogy (direct instruction vs. discovery learning). We then look to see how various data science techniques that have been proposed to navigate the bias-variance tradeoff can yield insights for productively navigating these educational debates going forward.},

Despite this appeal, existing conformal methods can be unnecessarily conservative because they form intervals of constant or weakly varying length across the input space. In this paper we propose a new method that is fully adaptive to heteroscedasticity. It combines conformal prediction with classical quantile regression, inheriting the advantages of both. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage, supplemented by extensive experiments on popular regression datasets. We compare the efﬁciency of conformalized quantile regression to other conformal methods, showing that our method tends to produce shorter intervals.},

            Digital signal processing (DSP) is one of the ‘foundational’ engineering topics of the modern world, without which technologies such the mobile phone, television, CD and MP3 players, WiFi and radar, would not be possible. A relative newcomer by comparison, statistical machine learning is the theoretical backbone of exciting technologies such as automatic techniques for car registration plate recognition, speech recognition, stock market prediction, defect detection on assembly lines, robot guidance and autonomous car navigation. Statistical machine learning exploits the analogy between intelligent information processing in biological brains and sophisticated statistical modelling and inference. DSP and statistical machine learning are of such wide importance to the knowledge economy that both have undergone rapid changes and seen radical improvements in scope and applicability. Both make use of key topics in applied mathematics such as probability and statistics, algebra, calculus, graphs and networks. Intimate formal links between the two subjects exist and because of this many overlaps exist between the two subjects that can be exploited to produce new DSP tools of surprising utility, highly suited to the contemporary world of pervasive digital sensors and high-powered and yet cheap, computing hardware. This book gives a solid mathematical foundation to, and details the key concepts and algorithms in, this important topic.},

Here I describe a maximum-likelihood approach to quantifying the significance of differences between estimates of template. Four methodologically related experiments illustrate the versatility of reverse correlation. Experiment 1 shows significant differences between the templates used by different observers when detecting a bright Gaussian blob. The results of Experiment 2 are consistent with observers not using information about the phase of a parafoveal wavelet when detecting it. Experiments 3 and 4 reveal not only the templates used by detection mechanisms but also aspects of their response functions. Both results are consistent with a sensory threshold. Experiment 3 shows that 2-alternative forced-choice detection errors are caused when the target’s effective contrast is reduced, not when the mask looks more like the expected target+mask than the actual target+mask. Experiment 4 suggests that observers use optimally tuned detection templates for orientation discrimination.},

	abstract = {External noise methods and observer models have been widely used to characterize the intrinsic perceptual limitations of human observers and changes of the perceptual limitations associated with cognitive, developmental, and disease processes by highlighting the variance of internal representations. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of the 5 most prominent observer models through the development of a common formalism. They derived new predictions of the models for a common set of behavioral tests that were compared with the data in the literature and a new experiment. The comparison between the model predictions and the empirical data resulted in very strong constraints on the observer models. The perceptual template model provided the best account of all the empirical data in the visual domain. The choice of the observer model has significant implications for the interpretation of data from other external noise paradigms, as well as studies using external noise to assay changes of perceptual limitations associated with observer states. The empirical and theoretical development suggests possible parallel developments in other sensory modalities and studies of high-level cognitive processes.},

	abstract = {The transmission of weak signals through the visual system is limited by internal noise. Its level can be estimated by adding external noise, which increases the variance within the detecting mechanism, causing masking. But experiments with white noise fail to meet three predictions: (a) noise has too small an influence on the slope of the psychometric function, (b) masking occurs even when the noise sample is identical in each two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) interval, and (c) double-pass consistency is too low. We show that much of the energy of 2D white noise masks extends well beyond the pass-band of plausible detecting mechanisms and that this suppresses signal activity. These problems are avoided by restricting the external noise energy to the target mechanisms by introducing a pedestal with a mean contrast of 0\% and independent contrast jitter in each 2AFC interval (termed zero-dimensional [0D] noise). We compared the jitter condition to masking from 2D white noise in double-pass masking and (novel) contrast matching experiments. Zero-dimensional noise produced the strongest masking, greatest double-pass consistency, and no suppression of perceived contrast, consistent with a noisy ideal observer. Deviations from this behavior for 2D white noise were explained by cross-channel suppression with no need to appeal to induced internal noise or uncertainty. We conclude that (a) results from previous experiments using white pixel noise should be re-evaluated and (b) 0D noise provides a cleaner method for investigating internal variability than pixel noise. Ironically then, the best external noise stimulus does not look noisy.},

	abstract = {A speech production impairment can occur following damage to either the left or right hemisphere. The nature of the impairment, however, differs depending on which hemisphere is damaged and within the left hemisphere, whether the damage is to the anterior or posterior language areas. This paper reviews the recent literature on the types of speech production impairments that follow damage to the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Damage to the left hemisphere anterior language area causes primarily a phonetic impairment, i.e. a deficit in executing the articulatory maneuvers of sound production with a preserved ability to select the correct sound. Damage to the left hemisphere posterior language area causes primarily a phonological impairment, i.e. a deficit in the correct selection of a sound with an intact ability to implement the articulatory maneuvers for that incorrect sound. Damage to the right hemisphere can cause a speech production problem to the prosodic aspects of language. These differences have direct implications for the theraputic remediation of these speech production impairments. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Investigations of prosodic processing in brain-damaged patients have primarily focused on hemispheric specialisations in the processing of prosodic structures. Most studies of receptive prosodic abilities in brain-damaged people share a common methodological approach, i.e., they are based on explicit tasks. No attention has been paid so far to the impact of explicit or implicit experimental methodologies. Aims: The aim of this study was to compare implicit and explicit experimental paradigms of receptive prosodic processing in patients with focal left and right hemisphere lesions.
Methods \& Procedures: Two implicit processing paradigms were used to investigate the comprehension of turn-related prosody (turn-detection task) and of prosodic focus (phoneme-detection task) in patients with focal cerebro-vascular lesions to the left or right cerebral hemisphere. The results were compared with explicit processing data of two matched patient groups selected from a larger sample of an earlier study. Outcomes \& Results: (a) In the turn-detection experiment normal subjects and left hemisphere damaged patients relied on prosodic information to detect conversational turns, whereas right hemisphere damaged patients were unable to benefit from the prosodic structure of utterances. A comparison of these results with the performance of two matched patient groups on an explicit ``non-linguistic prosodic'' paradigm (rating of emotional prosody) revealed the same pattern. b) In the phoneme-detection experiment prosodic focus information influenced detection latencies in both patient groups, i.e., RHD and LHD patients were able to process prosodic focus in an implicit manner. In the explicit processing of prosodic focus (identification task), RHD patients were moderately disturbed, while LHD patients showed more severe impairments.
Conclusions: The finding that RHD patients showed impaired performance in three out of four tasks confirmed a substantial deficit in the processing of prosodic information. Their preserved performance in the implicit processing of prosodic focus can be explained by the presence of local cues. On the contrary, the results of the LHD subjects indicate that earlier findings of an impaired prosodic focus processing in these patients might be attributable to the explicit nature of the tasks used in most studies rather than to a primary deficit in the processing of prosodic structures.},

	abstract = {The right hemisphere has often been claimed to be a locus for affective prosody, and people with right-hemisphere damage (RHD) have often been reported to show impairments in this domain. This phenomenon has been primarily investigated in terms of perception, more rarely in terms of production, and more rarely still using acoustic analysis. Our goal was to systematically review the papers reporting acoustic features of prosodic production in RHD, to identify strengths and weaknesses in this field, suggest guidelines for future research, and to support cumulative research by estimating the meta-analytic effect size of those features. We queried PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using the following combination of search terms: (prosody OR intonation OR inflection OR intensity OR pitch OR fundamental frequency OR speech rate OR voice quality) AND (RHD OR right hemisphere) AND (stroke) AND (acoustic). Standardized mean differences were extracted from all papers meeting inclusion criteria, and aggregated effect sizes were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian regression models. Sixteen papers met our inclusion criteria. We did not find strong evidence in the literature to indicate that the prosodic productions of people with RHD is substantially different from that of NBD controls, when measured in terms of acoustic features. However, the acoustic features of productions by people with RHD did differ from those of participants with NBD and LHD in some ways, notably in F0 variation and pause duration. Prosody type (emotional vs. linguistic) had very little effect. Taken together, currently available data show only a weak effect of RHD on prosody production. However, more accurate analyses are hindered by small sample sizes, lack of detail on lesion location, and divergent measuring techniques. Cumulative open science practices are recommended to overcome these issues.},

	abstract = {Research has suggested that conceptual processing depends on both language-based and sensorimotor information. In this thesis, I investigate the nature of these systems and their interplay at three levels of the experimental structure—namely, individuals, words and tasks. In Study 1, I contributed to a multi-lab replication of the object orientation effect, which has been used to test sensorimotor simulation. The effect did not appear in any of the 18 languages examined, and it was not influenced by individual differences in mental rotation. Next, in Study 2, we drew on three existing data sets that implemented semantic priming, semantic decision and lexical decision. We extended these data sets with measures of language-based and vision-based information, and analysed their interactions with participants’ vocabulary size and gender, and with presentation speed. The analysis had a conservative structure of fixed and random effects. First, we found that language-based information was more important than vision-based information. Second, in the semantic priming study—whose task required distinguishing between words and nonwords—, both language-based and vision-based information were more influential when words were presented faster. Third, a ‘task-relevance advantage’ was identified in higher-vocabulary participants. Specifically, in lexical decision, higher-vocabulary participants were more sensitive to language-based information than lower-vocabulary participants, whereas in semantic decision, higher-vocabulary participants were more sensitive to word concreteness. Fourth, we demonstrated the influence of the analytical method on the results. Last, we estimated the sample size required to investigate various effects. We found that 300 participants were sufficient to examine the effect of language-based information in words, whereas more than 1,000 participants were necessary to examine the effect of vision-based information and the interactions of both former variables with vocabulary size, gender and presentation speed. This power analysis suggests that larger sample sizes are necessary to investigate perceptual simulation and individual differences in conceptual processing.},

This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection.

Methods: Ten normal-hearing subjects assessed the subjective similarity of random auditory stimuli and target tinnitus-like sounds (“buzzing” and “roaring”). Reconstructions of the targets were obtained by regressing subject responses on the stimuli, and were compared for accuracy to the frequency spectra of the targets using Pearson’s r. Results: Reconstruction accuracy was signiﬁcantly higher than chance across subjects: buzzing: 0.52 ± 0.27 (mean ± s.d.), t(9) = 5.766, p {\textless} 0.001; roaring: 0.62 ± 0.23, t(9) = 5.76, p {\textless} 0.001; combined: 0.57 ± 0.25, t(19) = 7.542, p {\textless} 0.001.

	abstract = {In a wide variety of cognitive domains, participants have access to several alternative strategies to perform a particular task and, on each trial, one specific strategy is selected and executed. Determining how many strategies are used by a participant as well as their identification at a trial level is a challenging problem for researchers. In the current paper, we propose a new method – the non-parametric mixture model – to efficiently disentangle hidden strategies in cognitive psychological data, based on observed response times. The developed method derived from standard hidden Markov modeling. Importantly, we used a model-free approach where a particular shape of a response time distribution does not need to be assumed. This has the considerable advantage of avoiding potentially unreliable results when an inappropriate response time distribution is assumed. Through three simulation studies and two applications to real data, we repeatedly demonstrated that the nonparametric mixture model is able to reliably recover hidden strategies present in the data as well as to accurately estimate the number of concurrent strategies. The results also showed that this new method is more efficient than a standard parametric approach. The non-parametric mixture model is therefore a useful statistical tool for strategy identification that can be applied in many areas of cognitive psychology. To this end, practical guidelines are provided for researchers wishing to apply the non-parametric mixture models on their own data set.},

However, the lateralization of this complex processing in emotion recognition remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated emotional prosody recognition in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (model of basal ganglia dysfunction) or cerebellar stroke patients, as well as in matched healthy controls (n = 24 in each group). We analysed performances according to the lateralization of the predominant brain degeneration/lesion. Results showed that a right (basal ganglia and cerebellar) hemispheric dysfunction was likely to induce greater deficits than a left one. Moreover, deficits following left hemispheric dysfunction were only observed in cerebellar stroke patients, and these deficits resembled those observed after degeneration of the right basal ganglia. Additional analyses taking disease duration / time since stroke into consideration revealed a worsening of performances in patients with predominantly right-sided lesions over time. These results point to the differential, but complementary, involvement of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in emotional prosody decoding, with a probable hemispheric specialization according to the level of cognitive integration.},

Extending the signal detection theory (SDT) approach of Galvin, Podd, Drga, and Whitmore (2003), we propose a method of measuring type 2 sensitivity that is free from these confounds. We call our measure meta-d0, which reﬂects how much information, in signal-to-noise units, is available for metacognition. Applying this novel method in a 2interval forced choice visual task, we found that subjects’ metacognitive sensitivity was close to, but signiﬁcantly below, optimality.

How should we quantitatively measure such ability? Here we focus on a class of measures that assess the correspondence between trial-by-trial accuracy and one’s own conﬁdence. In general, for healthy subjects endowed with metacognitive sensitivity, when one is conﬁdent, one is more likely to be correct. Thus, the degree of association between accuracy and conﬁdence can be taken as a quantitative measure of metacognition. However, many studies use a statistical correlation coefﬁcient (e.g., Pearson’s r) or its variant to assess this degree of association, and such measures are susceptible to undesirable inﬂuences from factors such as response biases. Here we review other measures based on signal detection theory and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis that are “bias free,” and relate these quantities to the calibration and discrimination measures developed in the probability estimation literature. We go on to distinguish between the related concepts of metacognitive bias (a difference in subjective conﬁdence despite basic task performance remaining constant), metacognitive sensitivity (how good one is at distinguishing between one’s own correct and incorrect judgments) and metacognitive efﬁciency (a subject’s level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance). Finally, we discuss how these three concepts pose interesting questions for the study of metacognition and conscious awareness.},

            Goal-directed behavior depends on both sensory mechanisms that gather information from the outside world and decision-making mechanisms that select appropriate behavior based on that sensory information. Psychophysical reverse correlation is commonly used to quantify how fluctuations of sensory stimuli influence behavior and is generally believed to uncover the spatiotemporal weighting functions of sensory processes. Here we show that reverse correlations also reflect decision-making processes and can deviate significantly from the true sensory filters. Specifically, changes of decision bound and mechanisms of evidence integration systematically alter psychophysical reverse correlations. Similarly, trial-to-trial variability of sensory and motor delays and decision times causes systematic distortions in psychophysical kernels that should not be attributed to sensory mechanisms. We show that ignoring details of the decision-making process results in misinterpretation of reverse correlations, but proper use of these details turns reverse correlation into a powerful method for studying both sensory and decision-making mechanisms.},

Fifty-seven children and adolescents with ASD or with typical development (TD) had to determine the average direction of movement of 30 Laplacian-of-Gaussian micro-patterns. They moved in directions determined by a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 2◦, 5◦, 10◦, 15◦, 25◦, and 35◦, corresponding to the added external noise. The data obtained showed that the ASD group has much larger individual differences in motion direction thresholds on external noise effect than the TD group. Applying the equivalent noise paradigm, we found that the global motion direction discrimination thresholds were more elevated in ASD than in controls at all noise levels. These results suggest that ASD individuals have a poor ability to integrate the local motion information in low-density displays.},

            Motion perception is affected by healthy aging, which impairs the ability of older adults to perform some daily activities such as driving. The current study investigated the underlying causes of age-related motion contrast sensitivity losses by using an equivalent noise paradigm to decompose motion contrast sensitivity into calculation efficiency, the temporal modulation transfer function (i.e., temporal blur) and 3 sources of internal noise: stochastic absorption of photons by photoreceptors (i.e., photon noise), neural noise occurring at the retinal level (i.e., early noise) and at the cortical level (i.e., late noise). These sources of internal noise can be disentangled because there impacts on motion contrast sensitivity vary differently as a function of luminance intensity. The impact of healthy aging on these factors was evaluated by measuring motion contrast sensitivity of young and older healthy adults at different luminance intensities, temporal frequencies and with/without external noise. The older adults were found to have higher photon noise, which suggests a lower photon absorption rate of cones. When roughly equating the amount of photons being absorbed by the photoreceptors, older adults had lower calculation efficiencies, but no significant aging effect was found on temporal modulation transfer function, early noise and late noise.},

However, more recent studies show significant interactions between these pathways by inducing the perception of motion (implied motion) from presenting the independent frames of static Glass patterns. The mechanisms behind such interaction are not adequately un­ derstood with studies showing a larger contribution of either a motion or form processing mechanism. In the current study, we adapted the equivalent noise paradigm to disentangle the effect of internal noise (local pro­ cessing) and sampling efficiency (global processing) on global motion, global form, and the interaction of both on the perception of implied motion using physically equivalent stimuli. Six visually normal observers discriminated the direction or orientation of random dot kinematograms (RDK), static Glass patterns (Glass), and dynamic Glass patterns (dGlass) whose directions/orientations were determined by the means of normal distributions with a range of direction/orientation variances that served as external noise. Thresholds (τ) showed a consistent pattern across observers and external noise levels, where τGlass {\textgreater} τdGlass {\textgreater} τRDK. Nested model comparisons where the thresholds were related to the external noise, internal noise, and the sampling efficiency revealed that the dif­ ference in performance between the tasks was best described by the change in sampling efficiency with invariable internal noise. Our results showed that the higher thresholds for implied motion compared to real motion could be due to inefficient pooling of local dipole orientation cues at global processing stages involving motion mechanisms.},

However, recent studies have reported examples of exceptions, where confidence and accuracy dissociate from each other. Explanations for such dissociations often involve dual-channel models, in which a cortical channel contributes to both accuracy and confidence, whereas a subcortical channel only contributes to accuracy. Here, we show that a single-channel model derived from signal detection theory (SDT) can also account for such dissociations. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the occipital cortex to disrupt the internal representation of a visual stimulus. The results showed that consistent with previous research, occipital TMS decreased accuracy. However, counterintuitively, it also led to an increase in confidence ratings. The data were predicted well by a single-channel SDT model, which posits that occipital TMS increased the variance of the internal stimulus distributions. A formal model comparison analysis that used information theoretic methods confirmed that this model was preferred over single-channel models, in which occipital TMS changed the signal strength or dual-channel models, which assume two different processing routes. Thus our results show that dissociations between accuracy and confidence can, at least in some cases, be accounted for by a single-channel model.},

            The brain efficiently processes multisensory information by selectively combining related signals across the continuous stream of multisensory inputs. To do so, it needs to detect correlation, lag and synchrony across the senses; optimally integrate related information; and dynamically adapt to spatiotemporal conflicts across the senses. Here we show that all these aspects of multisensory perception can be jointly explained by postulating an elementary processing unit akin to the Hassenstein–Reichardt detector—a model originally developed for visual motion perception. This unit, termed the multisensory correlation detector (MCD), integrates related multisensory signals through a set of temporal filters followed by linear combination. Our model can tightly replicate human perception as measured in a series of empirical studies, both novel and previously published. MCDs provide a unified general theory of multisensory processing, which simultaneously explains a wide spectrum of phenomena with a simple, yet physiologically plausible model.},

Furthermore, displays showed either a participant's own movements or those of another person, when different weights were lifted. The participants' task was to estimate the weight of the lifted objects. The results revealed that, although overall performance was not dependent on the visual conditions (working point versus stick diagram) or ownership conditions (self versus other), the kinematic cues used to perform the task differed as a function of these conditions. In addition, the kinematic parameters relevant for action observation did not match those relevant for action execution. This was confirmed in experiments by using artificially altered movement samples, where the variations in critical kinematic variables were manipulated separately or in combination. We discuss the implications of these results for the roles of motor simulation and visual analysis in action observation.},

Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise.

One of their major insights was the utility of adding external noise to the signals of interest. These methods have been enhanced in recent years by the addition of multipass and classification-image methods for opening up the black box. There remain a number of as yet unresolved issues. In particular, Birdsall developed a theorem that large amounts of external input noise can linearize nonlinear systems, and Tanner conjectured, with mathematical backup, that what had been previously thought of as a nonlinear system could actually be a linear system with uncertainty. Recent findings, both experimental and theoretical, have validated Birdsall’s theorem and Tanner’s conjecture. However, there have also been experimental and theoretical findings with the opposite outcome. In this paper we present new data and simulations in an attempt to sort out these issues. Our simulations and experiments plus data from others show that Birdsall’s theorem is quite robust. We argue that uncertainty can serve as an explanation for violations of Birdsall’s linearization by noise and also for reports of stochastic resonance. In addition, we modify present models to better handle detection of signals with both noise and pedestal backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Amblyopia results in a loss of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and position acuity. However, the nature of the neural losses is not yet fully understood. Here we report the results of experiments using noise to try to better understand the losses in amblyopia. Speciﬁcally, in one experiment we compared the performance of normal, amblyopic, and ideal observers for detecting a localized signal (a discrete frequency pattern or DFP) in ﬁxed contrast white noise. In a second experiment, we used visibility-scaled noise and varied both the visibility of the noise (from 2 to 20 times the noise detection threshold) and the spatial frequency of the signal. Our results show a loss of efﬁciency for detection of known signals in noise that increases with the spatial frequency of the signal in observers with amblyopia. To determine whether the loss of efﬁciency was a consequence of a mismatched template, we derived classiﬁcation images. We found that although the amblyopic observers’ template was shifted to lower spatial frequencies, the shift was insufﬁcient to account for their threshold elevation. Reduced efﬁciency in the amblyopic visual system may reﬂect a high level of internal noise, a poorly matched position template, or both. To analyze the type of internal noise we used an “N-pass” technique, in which observers performed the identical experiment N times (where N = 3 or 4). The amount of disagreement between the repeated trials enables us to parse the internal noise into random noise and consistent noise beyond that due to the poorly matched template. Our results show that the amblyopes’ reduced efﬁciency for detecting signals in noise is explained in part by reduced template efﬁciency but to a greater extent by increased random internal noise. This loss is more or less independent of external noise contrast over a log unit range of external noise.},

The response classification method estimates an observer’s template by measuring the influence of each pixel of external noise on the observer’s responses. A map that shows the influence of each pixel is called a classification image. Other authors have shown how to calculate classification images from external noise fields, but the optimal calculation has never been determined, and the quality of the resulting classification images has never been evaluated. Here we derive the optimal weighted sum of noise fields for calculating classification images in several experimental designs, and we derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the resulting classification images. Using the expressions for the SNR, we show how to choose experimental parameters, such as the observer’s performance level and the external noise power, to obtain classification images with a high SNR. We discuss two-alternative identification experiments in which the stimulus is presented at one or more contrast levels, in which each stimulus is presented twice so that we can estimate the power of the internal noise from the consistency of the observer’s responses, and in which the observer rates the confidence of his responses. We illustrate these methods in a series of contrast increment detection experiments.},

The human visual process can be characterized to varying degrees of ‘depth’, ranging from percentage of correct detections to detailed tuning and operating characteristics of the underlying perceptual mechanism. We challenge deep networks with the same stimuli/tasks used with human observers and apply equivalent characterization of the stimulus-response coupling. In general, we ﬁnd that popular DCN architectures do not account for signature properties of the human process. For shallow depth of characterization, some variants of network-architecture/trainingprotocol produce human-like trends; however, richer empirical descriptors expose glaring discrepancies. These results urge caution in assessing whether neural networks do or do not capture human behaviour: ultimately, our ability to assess ‘success’ in this area can only be as good as aﬀorded by the depth of behavioural characterization against which the network is evaluated. We propose a novel set of metrics/protocols that impose stringent constraints on the evaluation of DCN behaviour as adequate approximation of biological processes.},

	abstract = {Probability matching is a classic theory of decision making that was first developed in models of cognition. Posterior probability matching, a variant in which observers match their response probabilities to the posterior probability of each response being correct, is being used increasingly often in models of perception. However, little is known about whether posterior probability matching is consistent with the vast literature on vision and hearing that has developed within signal detection theory. Here we test posterior probability matching models using two tools from detection theory. First, we examine the models’ performance in a two-pass experiment, where each block of trials is presented twice, and we measure the proportion of times that the model gives the same response twice to repeated stimuli. We show that at low performance levels, posterior probability matching models give highly inconsistent responses across repeated presentations of identical trials. We find that practised human observers are more consistent across repeated trials than these models predict, and we find some evidence that less practised observers more consistent as well. Second, we compare the performance of posterior probability matching models on a discrimination task to the performance of a theoretical ideal observer that achieves the best possible performance. We find that posterior probability matching is very inefficient at lowto-moderate performance levels, and that human observers can be more efficient than is ever possible according to posterior probability matching models. These findings support classic signal detection models, and rule out a broad class of posterior probability matching models for expert performance on perceptual tasks that range in complexity from contrast discrimination to symmetry detection. However, our findings leave open the possibility that inexperienced observers may show posterior probability matching behaviour, and our methods provide new tools for testing for such a strategy.},

	abstract = {Motion perception is essential for visual guidance of behaviour and is known to be limited by both internal additive noise (arising from random fluctuations in neural activity), and by motion pooling (global integration of local motion signals across space). People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) display abnormalities in motion processing, which has been linked to both elevated noise and abnormal pooling. However, to date, the impact of a third limit induced internal noise (internal noise that scales up with increases is external noise) - has not been investigated in motion perception of any group. Here, we describe a new double-pass motion direction discrimination paradigm that quantifies additive noise, induced noise, and motion pooling. We measure the impact of induced noise on direction discrimination, which we ascribe to fluctuations in decision-related variables. We report that internal noise is higher individuals with high ASD traits only on coarse but not fine motion direction discrimination tasks. However, we report no significant correlations between autism traits, and additive noise, induced noise or motion pooling, in either task. We conclude that internal noise may be higher in individuals with many ASD traits, and that the assessment of induced internal noise is a useful way of exploring decision-related limits on motion perception, irrespective of ASD traits.},

	abstract = {Contrast is the most fundamental property of images. Consequently, any comprehensive model of biological vision must incorporate this attribute and provide a veritable description of its impact on visual perception. Current theoretical and computational models predict that vision should modify its characteristics at low contrast: for example, it should become broader (more lowpass) to protect from noise, as often demonstrated by individual neurons. We find that the opposite is true for human discrimination of elementary image elements: vision becomes sharper, not broader, as contrast approaches threshold levels. Furthermore, it suffers from increased internal variability at low contrast and it transitions from a surprisingly linear regime at high contrast to a markedly nonlinear processing mode in the lowcontrast range. These characteristics are hard-wired in that they happen on a single trial without memory or expectation. Overall, the empirical results urge caution when attempting to interpret human vision from the standpoint of optimality and related theoretical constructs. Direct measurements of this phenomenon indicate that the actual constraints derive from intrinsic architectural features, such as the co-existence of complex-cell-like and simplecell-like components. Small circuits built around these elements can indeed account for the empirical results, but do not appear to operate in a manner that conforms to optimality even approximately. More generally, our results provide a compelling demonstration of how far we still are from securing an adequate computational account of the most basic operations carried out by human vision.},

When these internally generated perturbations are sufﬁciently large, the behaviour of the system is not solely driven by the external stimulus but also by its own spontaneous variability. Behavioural internal noise can be quantiﬁed, provided it is expressed in relative units of the noise source externally applied by the stimulus. In humans performing sensory tasks at near threshold performance, the size of internal noise is roughly equivalent to the size of the response ﬂuctuations induced by the external noise source. It is not known how the human estimate compares with other animals, because behavioural internal noise has never been measured in other species. We have adapted the methodology used with humans to the zebraﬁsh, a small teleost that displays robust visually-guided behaviour. Our measurements demonstrate that, under some conditions, it is possible to obtain viable estimates of internal noise in this vertebrate species; the estimates generally fall within the human range, suggesting that the properties of internal noise may reﬂect general constraints on stimulus–response coupling that apply across animal systems with substantially different characteristics.},

This procedure relies on the fact that some correct responses result from guesses and reclassifies them as incorrect responses using a trial-by-trial reclassification evidence such as response time. It selects the optimal reclassification evidence criterion beyond which correct responses should be reclassified as incorrect responses. We show that the more difficult the task and the fewer the response alternatives, the more to be gained from this reclassification procedure. We illustrate the procedure on behavioral and ERP data from two different datasets (Caplette et al. NeuroImage 218, 116994, 2020; Faghel-Soubeyrand et al.

Contrast discrimination functions had a classical dipper shape. The main nding was that CRTs were shorter at low pedestal contrasts but longer at higher pedestal contrasts compared to detection, re ecting the behaviour of increment thresholds. Even when equalized for response accuracy, CRTs varied with pedestal contrast in a similar manner to the contrast increment thresholds. The nding that CRTs and contrast increment thresholds depended on pedestal contrast in a similar manner suggests that both share a common origin. This common origin is proposed to lie in the variability of the sensory effect which determines the variability of the information accumulation process, which in turn affects the response criterion and contrast increment thresholds. At low pedestals, a decrease in variability lowers thresholds and results in a lower response criterion, thereby accelerating reaction times. At high pedestals, increasing signal-dependent noise in ates variability and thus raises thresholds and the response criterion, which results in slower CRTs.},

	abstract = {Psychophysical contrast increment thresholds were compared with neuronal responses, inferred from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that contrast discrimination judgements are limited by neuronal signals in early visual cortical areas. FMRI was used to measure human brain activity as a function of stimulus contrast, in each of several identiﬁable visual cortical areas. Contrast increment thresholds were measured for the same stimuli across a range of baseline contrasts using a temporal 2AFC paradigm. FMRI responses and psychophysical measurements were compared by assuming that: (1) fMRI responses are proportional to local average neuronal activity; (2) subjects choose the stimulus interval that evoked the greater average neuronal activity; and (3) variability in the observer’s psychophysical judgements was due to additive (IID) noise. With these assumptions, FMRI responses in visual areas V1, V2d, V3d and V3A were found to be consistent with the psychophysical judgements, i.e. a contrast increment was detected when the fMRI responses in each of these brain areas increased by a criterion amount. Thus, the pooled activity of large numbers of neurons can reasonably well predict behavioral performance. The data also suggest that contrast gain in early visual cortex depends systematically on spatial frequency. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

            Perceptual decisions often require the integration of noisy sensory evidence over time. This process is formalized with sequential sampling models, where evidence is accumulated up to a decision threshold before a choice is made. Although intuition suggests that decision formation must precede the preparation of a motor response (i.e., the action used to communicate the choice), neurophysiological findings have suggested that these two processes might be one and the same. To test this idea, we developed a reverse-correlation protocol in which the visual stimuli that influence decisions can be distinguished from those guiding motor responses. In three experiments, we found that the temporal weighting function of oculomotor responses did not overlap with the relatively early weighting function of stimulus properties having an impact on decision formation. These results support a timeline in which perceptual decisions are formed, at least in part, prior to the preparation of a motor response.},

The results revealed that it is possible to predict the categorical responses with better-than-chance accuracy purely based on the spectro-temporal distribution of the random envelope fluctuations of the corresponding noises, without taking into account the actual targets or the signal-to-noise ratios used in the trials. The effect of the noise fluctuations explained on average 8.1\% of the participants’ responses in white noise, a proportion that increased up to 13.3\% for noises with a larger amount of fluctuations. The estimated time-frequency weights revealed that the measured effect originated from confusions between noise fluctuations and relevant acoustic cues from the target words. Substantially similar conclusions were obtained from simulations using an artificial listener. We argue that this token-specific effect of noise is a form of informational masking.},

            According to Bayesian models, both decisions and confidence are based on the same precision-weighted integration of prior expectations (“priors”) and incoming information (“likelihoods”). This assumes that priors are integrated optimally and equally in decisions and confidence, which has not been tested. In three experiments, we quantify how priors inform decisions and confidence. With a dual-decision task we create pairs of conditions that are matched in posterior information, but differ on whether the prior or likelihood is more informative. We find that priors are underweighted in discrimination decisions, but are less underweighted in confidence about those decisions, and this is not due to differences in processing time. The same patterns remain with exogenous probabilistic cues as priors. With a Bayesian model we quantify the weighting parameters for the prior at both levels, and find converging evidence that priors are more optimally used in explicit confidence, even when underused in decisions.},

An ACI provides thus a map of the participant’s listening strategy in a given task. In this study, we will present results obtained by two participants in a series of auditory revcorr experiments. In all experiments participants had to indicate which of two possible target sounds were presented.

	abstract = {While noise is generally believed to impair performance, the detection of weak stimuli can sometimes be enhanced by introducing optimum noise levels. This phenomenon is termed ‘Stochastic Resonance’ (SR). Past evidence suggests that autistic individuals exhibit higher neural noise than neurotypical individuals. It has been proposed that the enhanced performance in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) on some tasks could be due to SR. Here we present a computational model, lab-based, and online visual identification experiments to find corroborating evidence for this hypothesis in individuals without a formal ASD diagnosis. Our modeling predicts that artificially increasing noise results in SR for individuals with low internal noise (e.g., neurotypical), however not for those with higher internal noise (e.g., autistic, or neurotypical individuals with higher autistic traits). It also predicts that at low stimulus noise, individuals with higher internal noise outperform those with lower internal noise. We tested these predictions using visual identification tasks among participants from the general population with autistic traits measured by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). While all participants showed SR in the lab-based experiment, this did not support our model strongly. In the online experiment, significant SR was not found, however participants with higher AQ scores outperformed those with lower AQ scores at low stimulus noise levels, which is consistent with our modeling. In conclusion, our study is the first to investigate the link between SR and superior performance by those with ASD-related traits, and reports limited evidence to support the high neural noise/SR hypothesis.},

In this perspective, better characterization of individual perceptual strategies is an important step toward designing more effective speech-processing algorithms. Here, we describe two complementary approaches for (a) revealing the acoustic cues used by a participant in a /d/-/g/ categorization task in noise and (b) measuring the relative contributions of these cues to decision. These two approaches involve natural speech recordings altered by the addition of a “bump noise.” The bumps were narrowband bursts of noise localized on the spectrotemporal locations of the acoustic cues, allowing the experimenter to manipulate the consonant percept. The cue-weighting strategies were estimated for three groups of participants: 17 NH listeners, 18 HI listeners with highfrequency loss, and 15 HI listeners with flat loss. HI participants were provided with individual frequency-dependent amplification to compensate for their hearing loss. Although all listeners relied more heavily on the high-frequency cue than on the low-frequency cue, an important variability was observed in the individual weights, mostly explained by differences in internal noise. Individuals with high-frequency loss relied slightly less heavily on the high-frequency cue relative to the low-frequency cue, compared with NH individuals, suggesting a possible influence of supra-threshold deficits on cue-weighting strategies. Altogether, these results suggest a need for individually tailored speech-in-noise processing in hearing aids, if more effective speech discriminability in noise is to be achieved.},

	abstract = {It is still unclear whether the gradual improvement in amplitude-modulation (AM) sensitivity typically found in children up to 10 years of age reflects an improvement in “processing efficiency” (the central ability to use information extracted by sensory mechanisms). This hypothesis was tested by evaluating temporal integration for AM, a capacity relying on memory and decision factors. This was achieved by measuring the effect of increasing the number of AM cycles (2 vs 8) on AM-detection thresholds for three groups of children aged from 5 to 11 years and a group of young adults. AMdetection thresholds were measured using a forced-choice procedure and sinusoidal AM (4 or 32 Hz rate) applied to a 1024-Hz pure-tone carrier. All age groups demonstrated temporal integration for AM at both rates; that is, significant improvements in AM sensitivity with a higher number of AM cycles. However, an effect of age is observed as both 5-6 year olds and adults exhibited more temporal integration compared to 7-8 and 10-11 year olds at both rates. This difference is due to: (i) the 5-6 year olds displaying the worst thresholds with 2 AM cycles, but similar thresholds with 8 cycles compared to the 7-8 and 10-11 year olds, and, (ii) adults showing the best thresholds with 8 AM cycles but similar thresholds with 2 cycles compared to the 7-8 and 10-11 year olds. Computational modelling indicated that higher levels of internal noise combined with poorer short-term memory capacities in children accounted for the developmental trends. Improvement in processing efficiency may therefore account for the development of AM detection in childhood.},

	abstract = {The ability to detect amplitude modulation (AM) is essential to distinguish the spectro-temporal features of speech from those of a competing masker. Previous work shows that AM sensitivity improves until 10 years of age. This may relate to the development of sensory factors (tuning of AM filters, susceptibility to AM masking) or to changes in processing efficiency (reduction in internal noise, optimization of decision strategies). To disentangle these hypotheses, three groups of children (5–11 years) and one of young adults completed psychophysical tasks measuring thresholds for detecting sinusoidal AM (with a rate of 4, 8, or 32 Hz) applied to carriers whose inherent modulations exerted different amounts of AM masking. Results showed that between 5 and 11 years, AM detection thresholds improved and that susceptibility to AM masking slightly increased. However, the effects of AM rate and carrier were not associated with age, suggesting that sensory factors are mature by 5 years. Subsequent modelling indicated that reducing internal noise by a factor 10 accounted for the observed developmental trends. Finally, children's consonant identification thresholds in noise related to some extent to AM sensitivity. Increased efficiency in AM detection may support better use of temporal information in speech during childhood.},

Hangya, Sanders, and Kepecs ( 2016 ) have proposed that researchers can test the Bayesian model by deriving qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence (i.e., patterns that one would expect to see if an observer were Bayesian) and looking for those signatures in human or animal data. We examine two proposed signatures, showing that their derivations contain hidden assumptions that limit their applicability and that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for Bayesian confidence. One signature is an average confidence of 0.75 on trials with neutral evidence. This signature holds only when class-conditioned stimulus distributions do not overlap and when internal noise is very low. Another signature is that as stimulus magnitude increases, confidence increases on correct trials but decreases on incorrect trials. This divergence signature holds only when stimulus distributions do not overlap or when noise is high. Navajas et al. ( 2017 ) have proposed an alternative form of this signature; we find no indication that this alternative form is expected under Bayesian confidence. Our observations give us pause about the usefulness of the qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence. To determine the nature of the computations underlying confidence reports, there may be no shortcut to quantitative model comparison.},

            According to Bayesian models, both decisions and confidence are based on the same precision-weighted integration of prior expectations (“priors”) and incoming information (“likelihoods”). This assumes that priors are integrated optimally and equally in decisions and confidence, which has not been tested. In three experiments, we quantify how priors inform decisions and confidence. With a dual-decision task we create pairs of conditions that are matched in posterior information, but differ on whether the prior or likelihood is more informative. We find that priors are underweighted in discrimination decisions, but are less underweighted in confidence about those decisions, and this is not due to differences in processing time. The same patterns remain with exogenous probabilistic cues as priors. With a Bayesian model we quantify the weighting parameters for the prior at both levels, and find converging evidence that priors are more optimally used in explicit confidence, even when underused in decisions.},

This study capitalizes on this phenomenon to probe AM detection strategies for human listeners using a reverse correlation analysis. Eight normal-hearing listeners were asked to detect the presence of a 4-Hz sinusoidal AM target applied to a 1-kHz tone carrier using a yes-no task with 3000 trials/participant. All stimuli were embedded in a white-noise masker. A reverse-correlation analysis was then carried on the data to compute “psychophysical kernels” showing which aspects of the stimulus’ temporal envelope inﬂuenced the listener’s responses. These results were compared to data simulated with different implementations of a modulation-ﬁlterbank model. Psychophysical kernels revealed that human listeners were able to track the position of AM peaks in the target, similar to the models. However, they also showed a marked temporal decay and a consistent phase shift compared to the ideal template. In light of the simulated data, this was interpreted as an evidence for the presence of phase uncertainty in the processing of intrinsic envelope ﬂuctuations. VC 2022 Acoustical Society of America.},

Selective attention was evaluated by measuring the degree to which listeners were influenced by (i.e., gave weight to) each spectral region of the stimulus. Psychometric fits were also used to estimate levels of internal noise and bias. Levels of masking were found to decrease with age, becoming adult-like by 9 –11 years. This change was explained by improvements in selective attention alone, with older listeners better able to ignore noise similar in frequency to the target. Consistent with this, age-related differences in masking were abolished when the noise was made more distant in frequency to the target. This work offers novel evidence that improvements in selective attention are critical for the normal development of auditory judgments.},

	abstract = {In psychophysical studies, the psychometric function is used to model the relation between physical stimulus intensity and the observer’s ability to detect or discriminate between stimuli of different intensities. In this study, we propose the use of Bayesian inference to extract the information contained in experimental data to estimate the parameters of psychometric functions. Because Bayesian inference cannot be performed analytically, we describe how a Markov chain Monte Carlo method can be used to generate samples from the posterior distribution over parameters. These samples are used to estimate Bayesian confidence intervals and other characteristics of the posterior distribution. In addition, we discuss the parameterization of psychometric functions and the role of prior distributions in the analysis. The proposed approach is exemplified using artificially generated data and in a case study for real experimental data. Furthermore, we compare our approach with traditional methods based on maximum likelihood parameter estimation combined with bootstrap techniques for confidence interval estimation and find the Bayesian approach to be superior.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a description of the interrelation between two major properties of the responses recordable from auditory nerve fibers: frequency selectivity and partial synchrony between stimulus and response. In the course of this work the influence of nonlinearity on the cochlear encoding process can be assessed. The theory of the reverse-correlation technique is derived in a most general way. It is based on a model in which a filter—assumed to be linear—is followed by a stochastic pulse generator—the probability of producing an output pulse being an instantaneous but nonlinear function of its input signal. Insofar as such a model represents stimulus transformations in a primary auditory neuron, the technique can be applied to the responses recorded from an auditory nerve fiber. Several illustrative examples of experimental reverse-correlation functions−abbreviated: revcor functions—are presented and discussed. These functions have the general character of impulse responses of sharp bandpass filters. They show very little phase modulation. For noise stimuli of up to 70 dB per third octave the revcor functions are almost invariant. Above that level some (but not all) of the revcor functions show a loss of frequency selectivity. If a nerve fiber can be contacted for a sufficiently long time, it is possible to compare the response with that of a model filter, in which the revcor function of that fiber is substituted as its impulse response. The output signal of the model filter is shown to be a very good predictor of the firing probability of the fiber under study. This property is demonstrated for noise as well as for tone stimuli. There is surprisingly little evidence of nonlinear filtering in these results. This so-called simulation method can also be applied when the stimulus is switched on and off. The results show, apart from effects due to filtering, clear manifestations of fast adaptation. Again, the filtering appears to be independent of the latter effect. It is concluded that for wide-band noise and single-tone signals the firing probability is predominantly controlled by a linearly filtered version of the acoustical stimulus; this constitutes the principle of specific coding. The conspicuous absence of nonlinear effects in the results can partly be explained in terms of the response properties of a class of networks in which sharp filtering occurs after the generation of nonlinear distortion products. It can then be predicted that this property will hold only for wide-band and tonal stimuli. That our results show so little evidence of cochlear distortion appears to be a property of signal transformations and is not due to linearization tendencies of the experimental method.},

Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These ﬁndings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

Here we investigated how IIV in boldness (estimated by flight initiation distances) changed across two seasons—the dry, non-breeding season and the wet, breeding season—in a wild population of the Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps. We found significant differences in IIV both between individuals and seasons, and IIV was higher in the wet season, suggesting plasticity in IIV. Further, IIV was highly repeatable (r = 0.61) between seasons and we found strong negative correlations between consistent individual differences in flight initiation distances, i.e. their boldness, and individuals’ IIVs. We suggest that to understand personality in animals, researchers should generate a personality ‘profile’ that includes not only the relative level of a trait (i.e. its personality), but also its plasticity and variability under natural conditions.},

To that end, we estimated individual levels of internal noise from behavioral variability in an orientation discrimination task (with tilted gratings) using the double-pass procedure and the perceptual-template model. We also measured the effects of spatial attention in an acuity task: the participants reported the side of a square on which a small aperture appeared. Central arrows were used to engage sustained attention and peripheral cues to engage transient attention. We found reliable correlations between individual levels of internal noise and the effects of both types of attention, albeit of opposite directions: positive correlation with sustained attention and negative correlation with transient attention. These findings demonstrate that in­ ternal noise – a fundamental characteristic of visual perception – can predict individual differences in the effects of spatial attention, highlighting the intricate relations between perception and attention.},

	abstract = {Language is a defining human behavior and is dependent on networks interactions amongst broadly distributed neuronal substrates. Transient dynamics between language regions that underpin speech production have long been postulated, yet have proven challenging to evaluate empirically. We used direct intracranial recordings during single word production to create a finely resolved spatiotemporal atlas (134 patients, 25810 electrodes, 40278 words) of the entire language-dominant cortex and used this to derive single-trial state-space sequences of network motifs. We derived 5 discrete neural states during the production of each word, distinguished by unique patterns of distributed cortical interaction. This interactive model was significantly better than a model of the same design but lacking interactions between regions in explaining observed activity. Our results eschew strict functional attribution to localized cortical populations, supporting instead the idea that cognitive processes are better explained by distributed metastable network states.},

	abstract = {Psychophysical methods are widely used in neuroscience to investigate the quantitative relation between a physical property of the world and its perceptual representation provided by the senses. Recent studies introduced the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to ﬁt the responses of multiple participants in psychophysical experiments. Another approach (twolevel approach) requires ﬁtting psychometric functions to each individual participant data using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and then testing the hypotheses on the multiple participants by means of a second level analysis. For either options, the implementation of the statistical analysis in R is possible and beneﬁcial. Here, we introduce the package MixedPsy to model and ﬁt psychometric data in R, either with two-level and GLMM approaches. The package, freely available in the CRAN repository, uses diﬀerent methods for the estimation of Point of Subjective Equivalence (PSE) and Just Noticeable Diﬀerence (JND), and provides utilities for immediate visualization and plotting of the ﬁtted results. This manuscript aims to provide researchers with a practical tutorial for implementing a complete analysis pipeline for psychophysical data using MixedPsy and other packages and basic functionalities of the R programming environment.},

This is particularly apparent in binocular rivalry, where perception of competing stimuli shown to the left and right eyes alternates over time. We modulated rivalling stimuli using dynamic sequences of external noise of various rates and amplitudes. We repeated each external noise sequence twice, and assessed the consistency of percepts across repetitions. External noise modulations of sufficiently high contrast increased consistency scores above baseline, and were most effective at 1/8Hz. A computational model of rivalry in which internal noise has a 1/f (pink) temporal amplitude spectrum, and a standard deviation of 16\% contrast, provided the best account of our data. Our novel technique provides detailed estimates of the dynamic properties of internal noise during binocular rivalry, and by extension the stochastic processes that drive our perception and other types of spontaneous brain activity.},

	abstract = {Classification of plants according to their echoes is an elementary component of bat behavior that plays an important role in spatial orientation and food acquisition. Vegetation echoes are, however, highly complex stochastic signals: from an acoustical point of view, a plant can be thought of as a three-dimensional array of leaves reflecting the emitted bat call. The received echo is therefore a superposition of many reflections. In this work we suggest that the classification of these echoes might not be such a troublesome routine for bats as formerly thought. We present a rather simple approach to classifying signals from a large database of plant echoes that were created by ensonifying plants with a frequencymodulated bat-like ultrasonic pulse. Our algorithm uses the spectrogram of a single echo from which it only uses features that are undoubtedly accessible to bats. We used a standard machine learning algorithm (SVM) to automatically extract suitable linear combinations of time and frequency cues from the spectrograms such that classification with high accuracy is enabled. This demonstrates that ultrasonic echoes are highly informative about the species membership of an ensonified plant, and that this information can be extracted with rather simple, biologically plausible analysis. Thus, our findings provide a new explanatory basis for the poorly understood observed abilities of bats in classifying vegetation and other complex objects.},

We reduce the dimensionality of a set of face images using principal component analysis, and then train a set of linear classiﬁers on this reduced representation (linear support vector machines (SVMs), relevance vector machines (RVMs), Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), and prototype (prot) classiﬁers) using human classiﬁcation data. Because we combine a linear preprocessor with linear classiﬁers, the entire system acts as a linear classiﬁer, allowing us to visualise the decision-image corresponding to the normal vector of the separating hyperplanes (SH) of each classiﬁer. We predict that the female-tomaleness transition along the normal vector for classiﬁers closely mimicking human classiﬁcation (SVM and RVM [1]) should be faster than the transition along any other direction. A psychophysical discrimination experiment using the decision images as stimuli is consistent with this prediction.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the bottom-up inﬂuence of local image information on human eye movements. Most existing computational models use a set of biologically plausible linear ﬁlters, e.g., Gabor or Difference-of-Gaussians ﬁlters as a front-end, the outputs of which are nonlinearly combined into a real number that indicates visual saliency. Unfortunately, this requires many design parameters such as the number, type, and size of the front-end ﬁlters, as well as the choice of nonlinearities, weighting and normalization schemes etc., for which biological plausibility cannot always be justiﬁed. As a result, these parameters have to be chosen in a more or less ad hoc way. Here, we propose to learn a visual saliency model directly from human eye movement data. The model is rather simplistic and essentially parameter-free, and therefore contrasts recent developments in the ﬁeld that usually aim at higher prediction rates at the cost of additional parameters and increasing model complexity. Experimental results show that—despite the lack of any biological prior knowledge—our model performs comparably to existing approaches, and in fact learns image features that resemble ﬁndings from several previous studies. In particular, its maximally excitatory stimuli have center-surround structure, similar to receptive ﬁelds in the early human visual system.},

Nonetheless much of a visual scene is perceived after only a few saccadic eye movements, suggesting an effective strategy for selecting saccade targets. It has been known for some time that local image structure at saccade targets inﬂuences the selection process. However, the question of what the most relevant visual features are is still under debate. Here we show that center-surround patterns emerge as the optimal solution for predicting saccade targets from their local image structure. The resulting model, a one-layer feed-forward network, is surprisingly simple compared to previously suggested models which assume much more complex computations such as multi-scale processing and multiple feature channels. Nevertheless, our model is equally predictive. Furthermore, our ﬁndings are consistent with neurophysiological hardware in the superior colliculus. Bottom-up visual saliency may thus not be computed cortically as has been thought previously.},

However, there is a dearth of evidence-based receptive aprosodia treatment research in this clinical population. The purpose of the current study was to investigate an explicit training protocol targeting affective prosody recognition in adults with RHD and receptive aprosodia. Eighteen adults with receptive aprosodia due to acute RHD completed affective prosody recognition before and after a short training session that targeted proposed underlying perceptual and conceptual processes. Behavioral impairment and lesion characteristics were investigated as possible inﬂuences on training effectiveness. Affective prosody recognition improved following training, and recognition accuracy was higher for pseudo- vs. realword sentences. Perceptual deﬁcits were associated with the most posterior infarcts, conceptual deﬁcits were associated with frontal infarcts, and a combination of perceptual-conceptual deﬁcits were related to temporoparietal and subcortical infarcts. Several right hemisphere ventral stream regions and pathways along with frontal and parietal hypoperfusion predicted training effectiveness. Explicit acoustic-prosodic-emotion training improves affective prosody recognition, but it may not be appropriate for everyone. Factors such as linguistic context and lesion location should be considered when planning prosody training.},

	abstract = {This book provides a state-of-the-art survey of intonation and prosodic structure. Taking a phonological perspective, it shows how morpho-syntactic constituents are mapped to prosodic constituents according to well-formedness conditions. Using a tone-sequence model of intonation, it explores individual tones and how they combine, and discusses how information structure affects intonation in several ways, showing tones and melodies to be \&apos;meaningful\&apos; in that they add a pragmatic component to what is being said. The author also shows how despite a superficial similarity, languages differ in how their tonal patterns arise from tone concatenation. Lexical tones, stress, phrase tones, and boundary tones are assigned differently in different languages, resulting in great variation in intonational grammar, both at the lexical and sentential level. The last chapter is dedicated to experimental studies of how we process prosody. The book will be of interest to advanced students and researchers in linguistics, and particularly in phonological theory.},

	abstract = {Classification image and other similar noise-driven linear methods have found increasingly wider applications in revealing psychophysical receptive field structures or perceptual templates. These techniques are relatively easy to deploy, and the results are simple to interpret. However, being a linear technique, the utility of the classification-image method is believed to be limited. Uncertainty about the target stimuli on the part of an observer will result in a classification image that is the superposition of all possible templates for all the possible signals. In the context of a well-established uncertainty model, which pools the outputs of a large set of linear frontends with a max operator, we show analytically, in simulations, and with human experiments that the effect of intrinsic uncertainty can be limited or even eliminated by presenting a signal at a relatively high contrast in a classificationimage experiment. We further argue that the subimages from different stimulus-response categories should not be combined, as is conventionally done. We show that when the signal contrast is high, the subimages from the error trials contain a clear high-contrast image that is negatively correlated with the perceptual template associated with the presented signal, relatively unaffected by uncertainty. The subimages also contain a “haze” that is of a much lower contrast and is positively correlated with the superposition of all the templates associated with the erroneous response. In the case of spatial uncertainty, we show that the spatial extent of the uncertainty can be estimated from the classification subimages. We link intrinsic uncertainty to invariance and suggest that this signalclamped classification-image method will find general applications in uncovering the underlying representations of high-level neural and psychophysical mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for conﬁrmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justiﬁed by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for conﬁrmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

	abstract = {After a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N=22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N=12 healthy controls, the representation+noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Protocols https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05874011 Funding StatementThis study was funded by Fondation pour l’Audition FPA-RD-2021-12Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by Comite de Protection des Personnes CPP Ile-De-France V (ProsAVC, Decision of 22/07/2020)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The aim of the study was to examine the impact of the choice of model on the accuracy and the efficiency with which the relative weights were determined. A yes/no task was used with observers indicating whether or not there was an increment in level to the central component of an 11‐component standard. On each presentation the amplitudes of the individual components of the complex were randomly perturbed using draws from a normal distribution. When a large number of trials (1250) were used to estimate the relative weights, the four methods generated nearly identical weight estimates. When smaller numbers of trials were used (112), the different methods generated patterns of relative weights that were largely similar, and the patterns deviated only modestly from the large‐number solution. In terms of efficiency, the error boundaries of the different methods were nearly indistinguishable. All in all, the number of trials needed to obtain statistically significant weights is sufficiently large that there is no apparent advantage of using one method over the others.

The tone was present on half of the 400 trials and was centered in the noise bursts. Bandwidth and integration time estimates were found for each observer by correlating the observer ratings with the output of energy detectors of various bandwidths (20, 40, 100, 250 Hz) and integration times (50, 100, 300, 500 msec) to find the best correlating energy detector. The results, computed separately for signal (SN) and no signal (N) trials, indicate a bandwidth of 40 Hz and an integration time of 100 or 300 msec fit best on both SN and N trials. Energy variations in 25 50−Hz by 100−msec segments of the noise were correlated with the observer ratings and showed negative correlations in frequency and time intervals immediately surrounding the signal region on SN trials, but not on N trials. The results suggest observer monitor detectors sensitive to temporal and spectral changes in the energy of the noise bursts, not just the absolute level of the output of a simple filter−integrator energy detector. The N trial results are accounted for by assuming that the observer is looking for the same pattern of temporal and spectral changes as on SN trials, but is uncertain as to the exact location of the signal tone.

Despite the unprecedented ability of these artificial neural networks (ANNs) to capture responses in biological neural networks (brains) (Fig. lA; see 3 for a comprehensive review), and our full access to all internal model components (unlike the brain), ANNs are often referred to as "black boxes" with limited interpretability. Interpretability, however, is a multi-faceted construct that is used differently across fields. In particular, interpretability, or explainability, efforts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) focus on understanding how different model components contribute to its output (i.e., decision making). In contrast, the neuroscientific interpretability of ANNs requires explicit alignment between model components and neuroscientific constructs (e.g., different brain areas or phenomena, like recurrence 4 or top-down feedback 5). Given the widespread calls to improve the interpretability of AI systems 6, we here highlight these different notions of interpretability and argue that the neuroscientific interpretability of ANNs can be pursued in parallel with, but independently from, the ongoing efforts in AI. Certain ML techniques (e.g., deep dream, see Fig. lC) can be leveraged in both fields, to ask what stimulus optimally activates the specific model features (feature visualization by optimization), or how different features contribute to the model's output (feature attribution). However, without appropriate brain alignment, certain features (non-blue segments of the model in Fig. lC) will remain uninterpretable to neuroscientists.},

ANNs have been lauded as the current best models of information processing in the brain, but also criticized for failing to account for basic cognitive functions. We propose that arguing about the successes and failures of a restricted set of current ANNs is the wrong approach to assess the promise of neuroconnectionism. Instead, we take inspiration from the philosophy of science, and in particular from Lakatos, who showed that the core of scientific research programmes is often not directly falsifiable, but should be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights. Following this view, we present neuroconnectionism as a cohesive large-scale research programme centered around ANNs as a computational language for expressing falsifiable theories about brain computation. We describe the core of the programme, the underlying computational framework and its tools for testing specific neuroscientific hypotheses. Taking a longitudinal view, we review past and present neuroconnectionist projects and their responses to challenges, and argue that the research programme is highly progressive, generating new and otherwise unreachable insights into the workings of the brain.},

This paper is concerned with estimating this template using the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) experimental paradigm. The basic idea behind the estimation procedure is to average the noise fields of the images used in a 2AFC experiment with a weight that depends on whether the observer got the trial correct or incorrect. We describe a method that produces unbiased estimates of the observer template up to a constant of proportionality under the linear cross-correlation model. The method proposed here is different from some previous methods in the way it assigns weights to the noise fields and we show that the resulting errors in the estimated template are minimized. We also propose and validate a formula for approximating the error covariance associated with the template estimates.},

	abstract = {Purpose. Classification images are typically estimated by a weighted combination of means of the noise profiles from response/signal categories in a psychophysical experiment in which the signal is embedded in noise on a fraction of the trials. This method can be characterized as a linear model (LM). The result is often subsequently smoothed by some arbitrary amount to yield a cleaner image. We describe how to estimate classification images with alternative statistical methods that incorporate smoothing in the estimation process and that result in more accurate estimates, described with fewer parameters. Methods. The classification image observer can be directly modeled trial-by-trial as a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). We describe how to extend the GLM by adding smooth basis terms to the model matrix, to produce a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The GAM prediction is a smoothed template where the smoothing is chosen to minimize prediction error of the data. We compared the three methods on simulated data for experiments of 100 to 10000 trials and with a 2000-fold variation of noise added to the template. We also compared the methods on published data (Thomas \&amp; Knoblauch, 2005) for detection of a Gabor temporal luminance modulation. Results. For simulated data, the GAM method yielded a closer estimate to the underlying template than the other two in the presence of substantial amounts of noise. Interestingly, for the real data, the GAM estimate produced an image closer to the ideal template than the other two. In both cases, the GAM approach required about 1/3 to 1/2 fewer parameters to describe the data. Conclusion. A GAM approach to estimating classification images has the advantage of producing a more parsimonious estimate that is closer to the underlying template.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Choice behavior can vary from trial to trial, even with near-identical stimuli. This is commonly attributed to errors caused by internal neural noise (Faisal et al, 2010, Nat Rev Neurosci). An alternative theory (Beck et al, 2012, Neuron) is that variability could also arise from suboptimal inference. We designed two complementary tasks to separate noise from suboptimal inference. METHODS: During each trial in Task 1 (No Spin), a subject was presented with two roulette wheels where a fraction of each wheel is colored orange. The subject was asked to choose the wheel that has the larger proportion of orange. Making the correct choice won a monetary prize. In Task 2 (Spin), a subject was presented with the same pair of wheels and was asked to choose the wheel that has the larger chance of winning. After choosing, the wheels were spun and the subject won a monetary prize if the chosen wheel stopped in the orange. A staircase procedure was used to vary one wheel while the other acted as the test condition. There were 20 test conditions, uniformly distributed between [0.025,0.975] with 30 trials per condition. 20 naïve subjects performed both tasks. RESULTS: While the total number of wise (i.e. correct) choices differed from subject to subject, 20/20 subjects made more wise choices in the No Spin task (median=489/600) than the Spin task (median=444/600). For 19/20 subjects, the median angular difference between both wheels in unwise choice trials is significantly larger for the Spin task. CONCLUSIONS: Both tasks have the same optimal solution: choose the wheel with more orange. The No Spin task established a baseline for errors caused by internal noise while the Spin task measured the incremental error arising from suboptimal inference, allowing for separation of both types of errors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Hemispheric specialization for the comprehension and expression of linguistic and emotional prosody is typically attributed to the right hemisphere. This study used techniques adapted from meta-analysis to critically examine the strength of existing evidence for hemispheric lateralization of prosody following brain damage.
Method: Twenty-one databases were searched for articles published from 1970 to 2020 addressing differences in prosody performance between groups defined by right hemisphere damage and left hemisphere damage. Hedges’s g effect sizes were calculated for all possible prosody comparisons. Primary analyses summarize effects for four types: linguistic production, linguistic comprehension, emotion comprehension, and emotion production. Within each primary analysis, Hedges’s g values were averaged across comparisons (usually from a single article) based on the same sample of individuals. Secondary analyses explore more specific classifications of comparisons.
Results: Out of the 113 articles investigating comprehension and production of emotional and linguistic prosody, 62 were deemed appropriate for data extraction, but only 21 met inclusion criteria, passed quality reviews, and provided sufficient information for analysis. Evidence from this review illustrates the heterogeneity of research methods and results from studies that have investigated aprosodia. This review provides inconsistent support for selective contribution of the two cerebral hemispheres to prosody comprehension and production; however, the strongest finding suggests that right hemisphere lesions disrupt emotional prosody comprehension more than left hemisphere lesions.
Conclusion: This review highlights the impoverished nature of the existing literature; offers suggestions for future research; and highlights relevant clinical implications for the prognostication, evaluation, and treatment of aprosodia.},

            A human brain imaging study reveals that low-level acoustical cues support hemispheric lateralization of speech and music perception.
          , 
            Does brain asymmetry for speech and music emerge from acoustical cues or from domain-specific neural networks? We selectively filtered temporal or spectral modulations in sung speech stimuli for which verbal and melodic content was crossed and balanced. Perception of speech decreased only with degradation of temporal information, whereas perception of melodies decreased only with spectral degradation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed that the neural decoding of speech and melodies depends on activity patterns in left and right auditory regions, respectively. This asymmetry is supported by specific sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation rates within each region. Finally, the effects of degradation on perception were paralleled by their effects on neural classification. Our results suggest a match between acoustical properties of communicative signals and neural specializations adapted to that purpose.},

	abstract = {During conversations, speech prosody provides important clues about the speaker’s communicative intentions. In many languages, a rising vocal pitch at the end of a sentence typically expresses a question function, whereas a falling pitch suggests a statement. Here, the neurophysiological basis of intonation and speech act understanding were investigated with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to determine whether prosodic features are ref lected at the neurophysiological level. Already approximately 100 ms after the sentence-final word differing in prosody, questions, and statements expressed with the same sentences led to different neurophysiological activity recorded in the event-related potential. Interestingly, low-pass filtered sentences and acoustically matched nonvocal musical signals failed to show any neurophysiological dissociations, thus suggesting that the physical intonation alone cannot explain this modulation. Our results show rapid neurophysiological indexes of prosodic communicative information processing that emerge only when pragmatic and lexico-semantic information are fully expressed. The early enhancement of question-related activity compared with statements was due to sources in the articulatory-motor region, which may ref lect the richer action knowledge immanent to questions, namely the expectation of the partner action of answering the question. The present findings demonstrate a neurophysiological correlate of prosodic communicative information processing, which enables humans to rapidly detect and understand speaker intentions in linguistic interactions.},

	abstract = {Speech intelligibility depends on the integrity of spectrotemporal patterns in the signal. The current study is concerned with the speech modulation power spectrum (MPS), which is a two-dimensional representation of energy at different combinations of temporal and spectral (i.e., spectrotemporal) modulation rates. A psychophysical procedure was developed to identify the regions of the MPS that contribute to successful reception of auditory sentences. The procedure, based on the two-dimensional image classification technique known as “bubbles” (Gosselin and Schyns (2001). Vision Res. 41, 2261–2271), involves filtering (i.e., degrading) the speech signal by removing parts of the MPS at random, and relating filter patterns to observer performance (keywords identified) over a number of trials. The result is a classification image (CImg) or “perceptual map” that emphasizes regions of the MPS essential for speech intelligibility. This procedure was tested using normal-rate and 2×-time-compressed sentences. The results indicated: (a) CImgs could be reliably estimated in individual listeners in relatively few trials, (b) CImgs tracked changes in spectrotemporal modulation energy induced by time compression, though not completely, indicating that “perceptual maps” deviated from physical stimulus energy, and (c) the bubbles method captured variance in intelligibility not reflected in a common modulation-based intelligibility metric (spectrotemporal modulation index or STMI).},

	abstract = {Comprehension of information conveyed by the tone of voice is highly important for successful social interactions (Grandjean et al., 2006). Based on lesion data, a superiority of the right hemisphere for cerebral processing of speech prosody has been assumed. According to an early neuroanatomical model, prosodic information is encoded within distinct right-sided perisylvian regions which are organized in complete analogy to the left-sided language areas (Ross, 1981). While the majority of lesion studies are in line with the assumption that the right temporal cortex is highly important for the comprehension of speech melody (Adolphs et al., 2001; Borod et al., 2002; Heilman et al., 1984), some studies indicate a widespread network of partially bilateral cerebral regions to contribute to prosody processing including the frontal cortex (Adolphs et al., 2002; Hornak et al., 2003; Rolls, 1999) and the basal ganglia (Cancellieve \& Kertesz, 1990; Pell \& Leonard, 2003). More recently, functional imaging experiments have helped to differentiate speciﬁc functions of distinct brain areas contributing to recognition of speech prosody (Ackermann et al., 2004; Schirmer \& Kotz, 2006; Wildgruber et al., 2006). Observations in healthy subjects indicate a strong association of cerebral responses and acoustic voice properties in some regions (stimulus-driven effects), whereas other areas show modulation of activation linked to the focusing of attention to speciﬁc task components (task-dependent effects). Here we present a reﬁned model of prosody processing and cross-modal integration of emotional signals from face and voice which differentiates successive steps of cerebral processing involving auditory analysis and multimodal integration of communicative signals within the temporal cortex and evaluative judgements within the frontal lobes.},

	abstract = {One view of speech perception is that acoustic signals are transformed into representations for pattern matching to determine linguistic structure. This process can be taken as a statistical pattern-matching problem, assuming realtively stable linguistic categories are characterized by neural representations related to auditory properties of speech that can be compared to speech input. This kind of pattern matching can be termed a passive process which implies rigidity of processing with few demands on cognitive processing. An alternative view is that speech recognition, even in early stages, is an active process in which speech analysis is attentionally guided. Note that this does not mean consciously guided but that information-contingent changes in early auditory encoding can occur as a function of context and experience. Active processing assumes that attention, plasticity, and listening goals are important in considering how listeners cope with adverse circumstances that impair hearing by masking noise in the environment or hearing loss. Although theories of speech perception have begun to incorporate some active processing, they seldom treat early speech encoding as plastic and attentionally guided. Recent research has suggested that speech perception is the product of both feedforward and feedback interactions between a number of brain regions that include descending projections perhaps as far downstream as the cochlea. It is important to understand how the ambiguity of the speech signal and constraints of context dynamically determine cognitive resources recruited during perception including focused attention, learning, and working memory. Theories of speech perception need to go beyond the current corticocentric approach in order to account for the intrinsic dynamics of the auditory encoding of speech. In doing so, this may provide new insights into ways in which hearing disorders and loss may be treated either through augementation or therapy.},

Ten females viewed pictures of happy and angry faces during two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan sessions: one prior (Pre) to onabotA and one following (Active) onabotA injections. We found Pre vs. Active onabotA modulation of activity in the amygdala for both happy and angry faces, as well as modulation of activity in the fusiform gyrus for happy faces.

The modulation of amygdala and fusiform gyrus activity following onabotA may reflect compensatory processes in a neuroanatomical circuit involved in emotional processing that is engaged when facial feedback is impaired.

Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place.

            Language comprehension involves integrating low-level sensory inputs into a hierarchy of increasingly high-level features. Prior work studied brain representations of different levels of the language hierarchy, but has not determined whether these brain representations are shared between written and spoken language. To address this issue, we analyze fMRI BOLD data that were recorded while participants read and listened to the same narratives in each modality. Levels of the language hierarchy are operationalized as timescales, where each timescale refers to a set of spectral components of a language stimulus. Voxelwise encoding models are used to determine where different timescales are represented across the cerebral cortex, for each modality separately. These models reveal that between the two modalities timescale representations are organized similarly across the cortical surface. Our results suggest that, after low-level sensory processing, language integration proceeds similarly regardless of stimulus modality.},

            Humans are capable of acquiring multiple types of information presented in the same information stream. It has been suggested that at least two parallel learning processes are important during learning of sequential patterns—statistical learning and rule‐based learning. Yet, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these parallel learning processes are not fully understood. To differentiate between the simultaneous mechanisms at the single trial level, we apply a temporal EEG signal decomposition approach together with sLORETA source localization method to delineate whether distinct statistical and rule‐based learning codes can be distinguished in EEG data and can be related to distinct functional neuroanatomical structures. We demonstrate that concomitant but distinct aspects of information coded in the N2 time window play a role in these mechanisms: mismatch detection and response control underlie statistical learning and rule‐based learning, respectively, albeit with different levels of time‐sensitivity. Moreover, the effects of the two learning mechanisms in the different temporally decomposed clusters of neural activity also differed from each other in neural sources. Importantly, the right inferior frontal cortex (BA44) was specifically implicated in visuomotor statistical learning, confirming its role in the acquisition of transitional probabilities. In contrast, visuomotor rule‐based learning was associated with the prefrontal gyrus (BA6). The results show how simultaneous learning mechanisms operate at the neurophysiological level and are orchestrated by distinct prefrontal cortical areas. The current findings deepen our understanding on the mechanisms of how humans are capable of learning multiple types of information from the same stimulus stream in a parallel fashion.},

Since its description in human infants, statistical learning has been described in human adults and several non-human species as a general process by which animals learn about stimulus-relevant statistics. The neurobiology of statistical learning is beginning to be understood, but many questions remain about the underlying mechanisms. Why is the developing brain particularly sensitive to stimulus and environmental statistics, and what neural processes are engaged in the adult brain to enable learning from statistical regularities in the absence of external reward or instruction? This review will survey the statistical learning abilities of humans and non-human animals with a particular focus on communicative vocalizations. We discuss the neurobiological basis of statistical learning, and specifically what can be learned by exploring this process in both humans and laboratory animals. Finally, we describe advantages of studying vocal communication in rodents as a means to further our understanding of the cortical plasticity mechanisms engaged during statistical learning. We examine the use of rodents in the context of pup retrieval, which is an auditory-based and experience-dependent form of maternal behavior.},

In order to address this currently unknown aspect, we investigated, in two independent experiments (NStudy1 = 186, NStudy2 = 180), the relationship between implicit statistical learning, measured by the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task, and executive functions, measured by multiple neuropsychological tests. In both studies, a modest, but consistent negative correlation between implicit statistical learning and most executive function measures was observed. Factor analysis further revealed that a factor representing the latent updating component of executive functions seemed to drive these negative correlations. Thus, an antagonism between implicit statistical learning and executive functions might specifically be mediated by updating.},

            Impairment in predictive processes gained a lot of attention in recent years as an explanation for autistic symptoms. However, empirical evidence does not always underpin this framework. Thus, it is unclear what aspects of predictive processing are affected in autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we tested autistic adults on a task in which participants acquire probability-based regularities (that is, a statistical learning task). Twenty neurotypical and 22 autistic adults learned a probabilistic, temporally distributed regularity for about 40 min. Using frequentist and Bayesian methods, we found that autistic adults performed comparably to neurotypical adults, and the dynamics of learning did not differ between groups either. Thus, our study provides evidence for intact statistical learning in autistic adults. Furthermore, we discuss potential ways this result can extend the scope of the predictive processing framework, noting that atypical processing might not always mean a deficit in performance.},

Relative to non-musicians, both musicians and Chinese had stronger brainstem representation of the defining pitches of musical sequences. In contrast, two behavioral pitch discrimination tasks revealed that neither Chinese nor non-musicians were able to discriminate subtle changes in musical pitch with the same accuracy as musicians. Pooled across all listeners, brainstem magnitudes predicted behavioral pitch discrimination performance but considering each group individually, only musicians showed connections between neural and behavioral measures. No brain-behavior correlations were found for tone language speakers or non-musicians. These findings point to a dissociation between subcortical neurophysiological processing and behavioral measures of pitch perception in Chinese listeners. We infer that sensory-level enhancement of musical pitch information yields cognitive-level perceptual benefits only when that information is behaviorally relevant to the listener.},

This is because expressions exist in a high-dimensional space too large to explore in conventional experimental paradigms. Here, we address this by adapting genetic algorithms and combining them with photorealistic three-dimensional avatars to efficiently explore the high-dimensional expression space. A total of 336 people used these tools to generate facial expressions that represent happiness, fear, sadness, and anger. We found substantial variability in the expressions generated via our procedure, suggesting that different people associate different facial expressions to the same emotional state. We then examined whether variability in the facial expressions created could account for differences in performance on standard emotion recognition tasks by asking people to categorize different test expressions. We found that emotion categorization performance was explained by the extent to which test expressions matched the expressions generated by each individual. Our findings reveal the breadth of variability in people’s representations of facial emotions, even among typical adult populations. This has profound implications for the interpretation of responses to emotional stimuli, which may reflect individual differences in the emotional category people attribute to a particular facial expression, rather than differences in the brain mechanisms that produce emotional responses.},

            It is now well established that extensive musical training percolates to higher levels of cognition, such as speech processing. However, the lack of a precise technique to investigate the specific listening strategy involved in speech comprehension has made it difficult to determine how musicians’ higher performance in non-speech tasks contributes to their enhanced speech comprehension. The recently developed Auditory Classification Image approach reveals the precise time-frequency regions used by participants when performing phonemic categorizations in noise. Here we used this technique on 19 non-musicians and 19 professional musicians. We found that both groups used very similar listening strategies, but the musicians relied more heavily on the two main acoustic cues, at the first formant onset and at the onsets of the second and third formants onsets. Additionally, they responded more consistently to stimuli. These observations provide a direct visualization of auditory plasticity resulting from extensive musical training and shed light on the level of functional transfer between auditory processing and speech perception.},

            Speakers of all human languages regularly use intonational pitch to convey linguistic meaning, such as to emphasize a particular word. Listeners extract pitch movements from speech and evaluate the shape of intonation contours independent of each speaker’s pitch range. We used high-density electrocorticography to record neural population activity directly from the brain surface while participants listened to sentences that varied in intonational pitch contour, phonetic content, and speaker. Cortical activity at single electrodes over the human superior temporal gyrus selectively represented intonation contours. These electrodes were intermixed with, yet functionally distinct from, sites that encoded different information about phonetic features or speaker identity. Furthermore, the representation of intonation contours directly reflected the encoding of speaker-normalized relative pitch but not absolute pitch.},

	abstract = {A number of evolutionary theories assume that music and language have a common origin as an emotional protolanguage that remains evident in overlapping functions and shared neural circuitry. The most basic prediction of this hypothesis is that sensitivity to emotion in speech prosody derives from the capacity to process music. We examined sensitivity to emotion in speech prosody in a sample of individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in processing acoustic and structural attributes of music. Twelve individuals with congenital amusia and 12 matched control participants judged the emotional expressions of 96 spoken phrases. Phrases were semantically neutral but prosodic cues (tone of voice) communicated each of six emotional states: happy, tender, afraid, irritated, sad, and no emotion. Congenitally amusic individuals were significantly worse than matched controls at decoding emotional prosody, with decoding rates for some emotions up to 20\% lower than that of matched controls. They also reported difficulty understanding emotional prosody in their daily lives, suggesting some awareness of this deficit. The findings support speculations that music and language share mechanisms that trigger emotional responses to acoustic attributes, as predicted by theories that propose a common evolutionary link between these domains.},

Whereas the nonlinearities have been well-characterised, there is less agreement about the speciﬁcs of internal noise. Psychophysical models assume that it impacts late in sensory processing, whereas neuroimaging and intracranial electrophysiology studies suggest that the noise is much earlier. We investigated whether perceptually-relevant internal noise arises in early visual areas or later decision making areas. We recorded EEG and MEG during a two-interval-forced-choice contrast discrimination task and used multivariate pattern analysis to decode target/non-target and selected/non-selected intervals from evoked responses. We found that perceptual decisions could be decoded from both EEG and MEG signals, even when the stimuli in both intervals were physically identical. Above-chance decision classiﬁcation started {\textless}100 ms after stimulus onset, suggesting that neural noise affects sensory signals early in the visual pathway. Classiﬁcation accuracy increased over time, peaking at {\textgreater}500 ms. Applying multivariate analysis to separate anatomically-deﬁned brain regions in MEG source space, we found that occipital regions were informative early on but then information spreads forwards across parietal and frontal regions. This is consistent with neural noise affecting sensory processing at multiple stages of perceptual decision making. We suggest how early sensory noise might be resolved with Birdsall's linearisation, in which a dominant noise source obscures subsequent nonlinearities, to allow the visual system to preserve the wide dynamic range of early areas whilst still beneﬁtting from contrast-invariance at later stages.

Its level can be estimated by adding external noise, which increases the variance within the detecting mechanism, causing masking. But experiments with white noise fail to meet three predictions: (a) noise has too small an influence on the slope of the psychometric function, (b) masking occurs even when the noise sample is identical in each two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) interval, and (c) double-pass consistency is too low. We show that much of the energy of 2D white noise masks extends well beyond the pass-band of plausible detecting mechanisms and that this suppresses signal activity. These problems are avoided by restricting the external noise energy to the target mechanisms by introducing a pedestal with a mean contrast of 0\% and independent contrast jitter in each 2AFC interval (termed zero-dimensional [0D] noise). We compared the jitter condition to masking from 2D white noise in double-pass masking and (novel) contrast matching experiments. Zero-dimensional noise produced the strongest masking, greatest double-pass consistency, and no suppression of perceived contrast, consistent with a noisy ideal observer. Deviations from this behavior for 2D white noise were explained by cross-channel suppression with no need to appeal to induced internal noise or uncertainty. We conclude that (a) results from previous experiments using white pixel noise should be re-evaluated and (b) 0D noise provides a cleaner method for investigating internal variability than pixel noise. Ironically then, the best external noise stimulus does not look noisy.},

In general, compared with the ideal observer, human observers were most efficient at performing tasks in low-pass noise, followed by white noise; they were least efficient in high-pass noise. Simulations demonstrated that contrastdependent internal noise was likely to have limited human performance in the high-pass conditions for both signal types. Classification images showed that observers were likely adopting different strategies in the presence of low-pass versus white noise. However, efficiencies were underpredicted by the linear classification images and asymmetries were present in the classification subimages, indicating the influence of nonlinear processes. Response consistency analyses indicated that lower contrast-dependent internal noise contributed somewhat to higher efficiencies in low-pass noise for Gabor patches but not objects. Taken together, the results of these experiments suggest a complex interaction among signals, external noise spectra, and internal noise in determining efficiency in correlated and uncorrelated noise.},

In a simulation study we present evidence that representation and decision noise can be separately estimated over a range of representative underlying representational and decision noise level configurations. These results also hold across a number of decision rules and show resilience to rule miss-specification. The new theoretical framework is applied to a visual detection confidence-rating task with three and five response categories.

Several factors affect each patient’s cognition, such as tumor location, treatment, medication, and comorbidities. However, impairments of processing speed, attention, concentration, working memory, and executive function are common across LrGG patients. Cognitive rehabilitation strategies, well established in traumatic brain injury and stroke populations, are based on neural plasticity and functional reorganization. Adapting these strategies for implementation in patients with brain tumors is an active area of research.This article provides an overview of cognitive domains commonly impaired in LrGG patients and evidence for the use of cognitive rehabilitation strategies to address these impairments with the goal of improving health-related quality of life in this patient population.},

This finding has been explained in terms of the distribution of a limited representational resource between items. Here we investigated how the sensory strength of memoranda affects resource allocation. We manipulated signal strength of an orientation stimulus in two ways: we varied the internal (sensory) noise by adjusting stimulus contrast, and varied the external (stimulus) noise by altering the withinstimulus variability. Both manipulations had similar effects on the precision with which the orientation could be recalled, but differed in their impact on memory for other stimuli. These results indicate that increasing internal noise released resources that could be used to store other stimuli more precisely; increasing external noise had no such effect. We show that these observations can be captured by a simple neural model of working memory encoding, in which spiking activity takes on the role of the limited resource.},

One fundamental, unresolved question is whether information processed prior to a decision being made (‘pre-decisional information’) has any influence on the likelihood and speed with which that decision is reversed. We investigated this using a luminance discrimination task in which participants indicated which of two flickering greyscale squares was brightest. Following an initial decision, the stimuli briefly remained on screen, and participants could change their response. Using psychophysical reverse correlation, we examined how moment-to-moment fluctuations in stimulus luminance affected participants’ decisions. This revealed that the strength of even the very earliest (pre-decisional) evidence was associated with the likelihood and speed of later changes of mind. To account for this effect, we propose an extended diffusion model in which an initial ‘snapshot’ of sensory information biases ongoing evidence accumulation.},

	abstract = {When a target stimulus occurs in the presence of distracters, decisions are less accurate. But how exactly do distracters affect choices? Here, we explored this question using measurement of human behaviour, psychophysical reverse correlation and computational modelling. We contrasted two models: one in which targets and distracters had independent influence on choices (independent model) and one in which distracters modulated choices in a way that depended on their similarity to the target (interaction model). Across three experiments, participants were asked to make fine orientation judgments about the tilt of a target grating presented adjacent to an irrelevant distracter. We found strong evidence for the interaction model, in that decisions were more sensitive when target and distracter were consistent relative to when they were inconsistent. This consistency bias occurred in the frame of reference of the decision, that is, it operated on decision values rather than on sensory signals, and surprisingly, it was independent of spatial attention. A normalization framework, where target features are normalized by the expectation and variability of the local context, successfully captures the observed pattern of results.},

	abstract = {Sleep deprivation has an ever-increasing impact on individuals and societies. Yet, to date, there is no quick and objective test for sleep deprivation. Here, we used automated acoustic analyses of the voice to detect sleep deprivation. Building on current machine-learning approaches, we focused on interpretability by introducing two novel ideas: the use of a fully generic auditory representation as input feature space, combined with an interpretation technique based on reverse correlation. The auditory representation consisted of a spectro-temporal modulation analysis derived from neurophysiology. The interpretation method aimed to reveal the regions of the auditory representation that supported the classifiers’ decisions. Results showed that generic auditory features could be used to detect sleep deprivation successfully, with an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art speech features. Furthermore, the interpretation revealed two distinct effects of sleep deprivation on the voice: changes in slow temporal modulations related to prosody and changes in spectral features related to voice quality. Importantly, the relative balance of the two effects varied widely across individuals, even though the amount of sleep deprivation was controlled, thus confirming the need to characterize sleep deprivation at the individual level. Moreover, while the prosody factor correlated with subjective sleepiness reports, the voice quality factor did not, consistent with the presence of both explicit and implicit consequences of sleep deprivation. Overall, the findings show that individual effects of sleep deprivation may be observed in vocal biomarkers. Future investigations correlating such markers with objective physiological measures of sleep deprivation could enable “sleep stethoscopes” for the cost-effective diagnosis of the individual effects of sleep deprivation.},

Despite the strength of evidence for perception-production transfer in speech, the nature of transfer has remained elusive, with variable results regarding the acoustic properties that transfer between speakers and the characteristics of the speakers who exhibit transfer. The current study investigates perception-production transfer through the lens of statistical learning across passive exposure to speech. Participants experienced a short sequence of acoustically variable minimal pair (beer/pier) utterances conveying either an accent or typical American English acoustics, categorized a perceptually ambiguous test stimulus, and then repeated the test stimulus aloud. In the canonical condition, /b/–/p/ fundamental frequency (F0) and voice onset time (VOT) covaried according to typical English patterns. In the reverse condition, the F0xVOT relationship reversed to create an “accent” with speech input regularities atypical of American English. Replicating prior studies, F0 played less of a role in perceptual speech categorization in reverse compared with canonical statistical contexts. Critically, this down-weighting transferred to production, with systematic down-weighting of F0 in listeners’ own speech productions in reverse compared with canonical contexts that was robust across male and female participants. Thus, the mapping of acoustics to speech categories is rapidly adjusted by short-term statistical learning across passive listening and these adjustments transfer to influence listeners’ own speech productions.},

	abstract = {Human perception depends upon internal representations of the environment that help to organize the raw information available from the senses by acting as reference patterns. Internal representations are widely characterized using reverse correlation, a method capable of producing unconstrained estimates of the representation itself, all on the basis of simple responses to random stimuli. Despite its advantages, reverse correlation is often infeasible to apply because of its inefficiency—a very large number of stimulus–response trials are required in order to obtain an accurate estimate. Here, we show that an important source of this inefficiency is small, yet nontrivial, correlations that occur by chance between randomly generated stimuli. We demonstrate in simulation that whitening stimuli to remove such correlations before eliciting responses provides greater than 85\% improvement in efficiency for a given estimation quality, as well as a two- to fivefold increase in quality for a given sample size. Moreover, unlike conventional approaches, whitening improves the efficiency of reverse correlation without introducing bias into the estimate, or requiring prior knowledge of the target internal representation. Improving the efficiency of reverse correlation with whitening may enable a broader scope of investigations into the individual variability and potential universality of perceptual mechanisms.},

            Contrast sensitivity varies substantially as a function of spatial frequency and luminance intensity. The variation as a function of luminance intensity is well known and characterized by three laws that can be attributed to the impact of three internal noise sources: early spontaneous neural activity limiting contrast sensitivity at low luminance intensities (i.e. early noise responsible for the linear law), probabilistic photon absorption at intermediate luminance intensities (i.e. photon noise responsible for de Vries-Rose law) and late spontaneous neural activity at high luminance intensities (i.e. late noise responsible for Weber’s law). The aim of this study was to characterize how the impact of these three internal noise sources vary with spatial frequency and determine which one is limiting contrast sensitivity as a function of luminance intensity and spatial frequency. To estimate the impact of the different internal noise sources, the current study used an external noise paradigm to factorize contrast sensitivity into equivalent input noise and calculation efficiency over a wide range of luminance intensities and spatial frequencies. The impact of early and late noise was found to drop linearly with spatial frequency, whereas the impact of photon noise rose with spatial frequency due to ocular factors.},

The deﬁcits were not due to poor spectral or temporal resolution because dyslexics exhibited normal ‘masking release’ effects (i.e. better performance in ﬂuctuating than in stationary noise). Moreover, speech-perception-in-noise predicted signiﬁcant unique variance in reading even after controlling for low-level auditory, attentional, speech output, short-term memory and phonological awareness processes. Finally, the presence of external noise did not seem to be a necessary condition for speech perception deﬁcits to occur because similar deﬁcits were obtained when speech was degraded by eliminating temporal ﬁne-structure cues without using external noise. In conclusion, the core deﬁcit of dyslexics seems to be a lack of speech robustness in the presence of external or internal noise.},

It is hoped that this systematic procedures to be followed will increase the usefulness of the book to the average research physiologist and, perhaps, reduce the need for in-depth knowledge of some of the associated mathematics. Even though the material deals with state-of-the­ art techniques in systems and signal analysis, the mathematical level has been kept low so as to be comprehensible to the average physiologist with no extensive training in mathematics.

	abstract = {Introduction: Glioma is a common brain tumor. It can impair various cognitive functions such as social cognition. Prosody, a component of social cognition, remains little studied in glioma patients. Aim: The main aim of the study is to identify any impairment in the recognition of linguistic and/or emotional prosody in patients with glioma, before and after surgery. Materials and methods: 23 patients with glioma were evaluated preoperatively and 19 postoperatively. Different tasks were used to test recognition of linguistic and emotional prosody (i-MEL, Reverse Correlation, Pseudophrases).
Results: Deficits in prosody recognition are diagnosed as early as the preoperative assessment, with greater impairment of linguistic prosody than emotional prosody. After surgery, a decline in performance is revealed. Finally, only for linguistic prosody, the postoperative drop in performance is greater in patients with a right-hemisphere lesion. For all these results, inter-individual variability is noted. Discussion: These data are relatively innovative, as few studies have looked at prosody in glioma patients. Among studies of brain-injured patients, aprosodia is regularly found. More research is needed in this area to further explore the mechanisms underlying prosodic alterations.
Conclusion: This study highlights the clinical and fundamental importance of studying prosody in patients. Indeed, they appear to present prosody recognition disorders preoperatively, with a decline in performance postoperatively.},

Recent work has produced methods for identifying these representations from observed behavior, such as reverse correlation (RC). We compare RC against an alternative method for inferring the structure of natural categories called Markov chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP). Based on an algorithm used in computer science and statistics, MCMCP provides a way to sample from the set of stimuli associated with a natural category. We apply MCMCP and RC to the problem of recovering natural categories that correspond to two kinds of facial affect (happy and sad) from realistic images of faces. Our results show that MCMCP requires fewer trials to obtain a higher quality estimate of people’s mental representations of these two categories.},

J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 147, 3260]. The goal of the present study was to assess this prediction for humans using 2 s samples taken from the same soundscape recordings. Thirty-one listeners were asked to discriminate these recordings based on differences in habitat, season, or period of the day using an oddity task. Listeners’ performance was well above chance, demonstrating effective processing of these differences and suggesting a general high sensitivity for natural soundscape discrimination. This performance did not improve with training up to 10 h. Additional results obtained for habitat discrimination indicate that temporal cues play only a minor role; instead, listeners appear to base their decisions primarily on gross spectral cues related to biological sound sources and habitat acoustics. Convolutional neural networks were trained to perform a similar task using spectro-temporal cues extracted by an auditory model as input. The results are consistent with the idea that humans exclude the available temporal information when discriminating short samples of habitats, implying a form of a sub-optimality.},

It has been assumed that humans share universal visual sampling strategies to achieve this task. However, recent studies in face identification have revealed striking idiosyncratic fixation patterns, questioning the universality of face processing. More importantly, very little is known about whether such idiosyncrasies extend to the biological relevant recognition of static and dynamic facial expressions of emotion (FEEs). To clarify this issue, we tracked observers’ eye movements categorizing static and ecologically valid dynamic faces displaying the six basic FEEs, all normalized for time presentation (1 s), contrast and global luminance across exposure time. We then used robust data-driven analyses combining statistical fixation maps with hidden Markov Models to explore eye-movements across FEEs and stimulus modalities. Our data revealed three spatially and temporally distinct equally occurring face scanning strategies during FER. Crucially, such visual sampling strategies were mostly comparably effective in FER and highly consistent across FEEs and modalities. Our findings show that spatiotemporal idiosyncratic gaze strategies also occur for the biologically relevant recognition of FEEs, further questioning the universality of FER and, more generally, face processing.},

            After a right hemisphere stroke, more than half of the patients are impaired in their capacity to produce or comprehend speech prosody. Yet, and despite its social-cognitive consequences for patients, aprosodia following stroke has received scant attention. In this report, we introduce a novel, simple psychophysical procedure which, by combining systematic digital manipulations of speech stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, allows estimating the internal sensory representations that subtend how individual patients perceive speech prosody, and the level of internal noise that govern behavioral variability in how patients apply these representations. Tested on a sample of N = 22 right-hemisphere stroke survivors and N = 21 age-matched controls, the representation + noise model provides a promising alternative to the clinical gold standard for evaluating aprosodia (MEC): both parameters strongly associate with receptive, and not expressive, aprosodia measured by MEC within the patient group; they have better sensitivity than MEC for separating high-functioning patients from controls; and have good specificity with respect to non-prosody-related impairments of auditory attention and processing. Taken together, individual differences in either internal representation, internal noise, or both, paint a potent portrait of the variety of sensory/cognitive mechanisms that can explain impairments of prosody processing after stroke.},

	abstract = {Extracting time-varying latent variables from computational cognitive models is a key step in model-based neural analysis, which aims to understand the neural correlates of cognitive processes. However, existing methods only allow researchers to infer latent variables that explain subjects’ behavior in a relatively small class of cognitive models. For example, a broad class of relevant cognitive models with analytically intractable likelihood is currently out of reach from standard techniques, based on Maximum a Posteriori parameter estimation. Here, we present an approach that extends neural Bayes estimation to learn a direct mapping between experimental data and the targeted latent variable space using recurrent neural networks and simulated datasets. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance in inferring latent variable sequences in both tractable and intractable models. Furthermore, the approach is generalizable across different computational models and is adaptable for both continuous and discrete latent spaces. We then demonstrate its applicability in real world datasets. Our work underscores that combining recurrent neural networks and simulation-based inference to identify latent variable sequences can enable researchers to access a wider class of cognitive models for model-based neural analyses, and thus test a broader set of theories.},

	abstract = {A central goal in neuroscience is to identify the strategies used by animals and humans as they make decisions, and to characterize the learning rules that shape these policies in the first place. In this thesis, I discuss three projects aimed at tackling this goal. In the first, we introduce a novel framework, the GLM-HMM, for characterizing mouse and human choice policies during binary decision-making tasks. The GLM-HMM is a hidden Markov model with Bernoulli Generalized Linear Model observations. By fitting the GLM-HMM to hundreds of thousands of decisions, our framework revealed that — contrary to common wisdom — mice and humans use multiple strategies over the course of a single session to perform perceptual decision-making tasks. In the second project, we sought to uncover the learning rules used by mice and rats as they learned to perform this type of task. Our model tracked trial-to-trial changes in the animals’ choice policies, and separated these changes into components explainable by a reinforcement learning rule, and components that remained unexplained. Whereas the average contribution of the conventional REINFORCE learning rule to the policy update for mice learning a common task was just 30\%, we found that adding baseline parameters allowed the learning rule to explain 92\% of the animals’ policy updates under our model. Finally, I discuss our approach to applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to the trajectories of mice exploring a maze environment. While IRL has been widely applied in robotics and healthcare settings to infer the unknown reward function of an agent, it has yet to be applied extensively in neuroscience. One potential reason for this is that existing IRL frameworks assume that an agent’s reward function is fixed over time. To overcome this limitation, we introduce ‘DIRL’, an IRL framework that allows for time-varying intrinsic rewards. Our method returns interpretable reward functions for two separate cohorts of mice, and provides a novel characterization of exploratory behavior. Overall, we anticipate ‘DIRL’ having broad applicability in neuroscience, and that it could also facilitate the design of biologically-inspired reward functions for training artificial agents to perform analogous tasks.},

            While judging their sensory environments, decision-makers seem to use the uncertainty about their choices to guide adjustments of their subsequent behaviour. One possible source of these behavioural adjustments is arousal: decision uncertainty might drive the brain’s arousal systems, which control global brain state and might thereby shape subsequent decision-making. Here, we measure pupil diameter, a proxy for central arousal state, in human observers performing a perceptual choice task of varying difficulty. Pupil dilation, after choice but before external feedback, reflects three hallmark signatures of decision uncertainty derived from a computational model. This increase in pupil-linked arousal boosts observers’ tendency to alternate their choice on the subsequent trial. We conclude that decision uncertainty drives rapid changes in pupil-linked arousal state, which shape the serial correlation structure of ongoing choice behaviour.},

	title = {Efficient inference for time-varying behavior during learning},
	abstract = {The process of learning new behaviors over time is a problem of great interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, most standard analyses of animal training data either treat behavior as fixed or track only coarse performance statistics (e.g., accuracy, bias), providing limited insight into the evolution of the policies governing behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic psychophysical model that efficiently tracks trial-to-trial changes in behavior over the course of training. Our model consists of a dynamic logistic regression model, parametrized by a set of time-varying weights that express dependence on sensory stimuli as well as task-irrelevant covariates, such as stimulus, choice, and answer history. Our implementation scales to large behavioral datasets, allowing us to infer 500K parameters (e.g., 10 weights over 50K trials) in minutes on a desktop computer. We optimize hyperparameters governing how rapidly each weight evolves over time using the decoupled Laplace approximation, an efficient method for maximizing marginal likelihood in non-conjugate models. To illustrate performance, we apply our method to psychophysical data from both rats and human subjects learning a delayed sensory discrimination task. The model successfully tracks the psychophysical weights of rats over the course of training, capturing day-to-day and trial-to-trial fluctuations that underlie changes in performance, choice bias, and dependencies on task history. Finally, we investigate why rats frequently make mistakes on easy trials, and suggest that apparent lapses can be explained by sub-optimal weighting of known task covariates.},

	abstract = {Peptide and protein identiﬁcation via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) lies at the heart of proteomic characterization of biological samples. Several algorithms are able to search, score, and assign peptides to large MS/MS datasets. Most popular methods, however, underutilize the intensity information available in the tandem mass spectrum due to the complex nature of the peptide fragmentation process, thus contributing to loss of potential identiﬁcations. We present a novel probabilistic scoring algorithm called Context-Sensitive Peptide Identiﬁcation (CSPI) based on highly ﬂexible Input-Output Hidden Markov Models (IO-HMM) that capture the inﬂuence of peptide physicochemical properties on their observed MS/MS spectra. We use several local and global properties of peptides and their fragment ions from literature. Comparison with two popular algorithms, Crux (re-implementation of SEQUEST) and X!Tandem, on multiple datasets of varying complexity, shows that peptide identiﬁcation scores from our models are able to achieve greater discrimination between true and false peptides, identifying up to *25\% more peptides at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 1\%. We evaluated two alternative normalization schemes for fragment ion-intensities, a global rank-based and a local window-based. Our results indicate the importance of appropriate normalization methods for learning superior models. Further, combining our scores with Crux using a state-of-the-art procedure, Percolator, we demonstrate the utility of using scoring features from intensity-based models, identifying *4-8 \% additional identiﬁcations over Percolator at 1\% FDR. IO-HMMs offer a scalable and ﬂexible framework with several modeling choices to learn complex patterns embedded in MS/MS data.},

When the system is observed from an external perspective, the control strategy may not be known and it should rather be reconstructed by joint observation of the applied control actions and the corresponding evolution of the system state. This is largely hurdled by limitations in the sensing of the system state and different levels of noise. We address the problem of optimal selection of control actions for a stochastic system with unknown dynamics operating under a controller with unknown strategy, for which we can observe trajectories made of the sequence of control actions and noisy observations of the system state which are labeled by the exact value of some reward functions. To this end, we present an approach to train an Input–Output Hidden Markov Model (IO-HMM) as the generative stochastic model that describes the state dynamics of a POMDP by the application of a novel optimization objective adopted from the literate. The learning task is hurdled by two restrictions: the only available sensed data are the limited number of trajectories of applied actions, noisy observations of the system state, and system state; and, the high failure costs prevent interaction with the online environment, preventing exploratory testing. Traditionally, stochastic generative models have been used to learn the underlying system dynamics and select appropriate actions in the deﬁned task. However, current state of the art techniques, in which the state dynamics of the POMDP is ﬁrst learned and then strategies are optimized over it, frequently fail because the model that best ﬁts the data may not be well suited for controlling. By using the aforementioned optimization objective, we try to to tackle the problems related to model mis-speciﬁcation. The proposed methodology is illustrated in a scenario of failure avoidance for a multi component system. The quality of the decision making is evaluated by using the collected reward on the test data and compared against the previous literature usual approach.},

	abstract = {Disease pathogenesis, a type of domain knowledge about biological mechanisms leading to diseases, has not been adequately encoded in machine-learning-based medical diagnostic models because of the inter-patient variabilities and complex dependencies of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. We propose 1) a novel pathogenesis probabilistic graphical model (PPGM) to quantify the dynamics underpinning patient-specific data and pathogenetic domain knowledge, 2) a Bayesian-based inference paradigm to answer the medical queries and forecast acute onsets. The PPGM model consists of two components: a Bayesian network of patient attributes and a temporal model of pathogenetic mechanisms. The model structure was reconstructed from expert knowledge elicitation, and its parameters were estimated using Variational Expectation­ Maximization algorithms. We benchmarked our model with two well-established hidden Markov models (HMMs) – Input-output HMM (IO-HMM) and Switching Auto-Regressive HMM (SAR­ HMM) – to evaluate the computational costs, forecasting performance, and execution time. Two case studies on Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) were used to validate the model. While the performance of the parameter learning step was equivalent to those of IO-HMM and SAR-HMM models, our model forecasting ability was outperforming those two models. The merits of the PPGM model are its representation capability to capture the dynamics of pathogenesis and perform medical inferences and its interpretability for physicians. The model has been used to perform medical queries and forecast the acute onset of OSA and PAF. Additional applications of the model include prognostic healthcare and preventive personalized treatments.},

	abstract = {In the auditory system, the stimulus-response properties of single neurons are often described in terms of the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), a linear kernel relating the spectrogram of the sound stimulus to the instantaneous firing rate of the neuron. Several algorithms have been used to estimate STRFs from responses to natural stimuli; these algorithms differ in their functional models, cost functions, and regularization methods. Here, we characterize the stimulusresponse function of auditory neurons using a generalized linear model (GLM). In this model, each cell’s input is described by: 1) a stimulus filter (STRF); and 2) a post-spike filter, which captures dependencies on the neuron’s spiking history. The output of the model is given by a series of spike trains rather than instantaneous firing rate, allowing the prediction of spike train responses to novel stimuli. We fit the model by maximum penalized likelihood to the spiking activity of zebra finch auditory midbrain neurons in response to conspecific vocalizations (songs) and modulation limited (ml) noise. We compare this model to normalized reverse correlation (NRC), the traditional method for STRF estimation, in terms of predictive power and the basic tuning properties of the estimated STRFs. We find that a GLM with a sparse prior predicts novel responses to both stimulus classes significantly better than NRC. Importantly, we find that STRFs from the two models derived from the same responses can differ substantially and that GLM STRFs are more consistent between stimulus classes than NRC STRFs. These results suggest that a GLM with a sparse prior provides a more accurate characterization of spectrotemporal tuning than does the NRC method when responses to complex sounds are studied in these neurons.},

We employ an appropriately modiﬁed expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The expectation step is solved by the standard forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. The maximization step reduces to a set of separable concave optimization problems if the model is restricted slightly. We ﬁrst test our algorithm on simulated data and are able both to fully recover the parameters used to generate the data and to accurately recapitulate the sequence of hidden states. We then apply our algorithm to a recently published data set in which the observed neuronal ensembles displayed multi-state behavior and show that inclusion of spike-history information signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁt of the model. Additionally, we show that a simple reformulation of the state-space of the underlying Markov chain allows us to implement a hybrid half-multistate/half-histogram model which may be more appropriate for capturing the complexity of certain data sets than either a simple HMM or a simple peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) model alone.},

We tested this new method in two datasets where spikes were simultaneously recorded using a multi-electrode array in the primary motor cortex of two monkeys.

This method also provides more accurate decoding of hand state (lowering the Mean Square Error by up to 29\% in some cases), while retaining real-time computational efficiency. These improvements on representation and decoding over the classical GLM model suggest that this new approach could contribute as a useful tool to motor cortical decoding and prosthetic applications.},

            Active learning seeks to reduce the amount of data required to fit the parameters of a model, thus forming an important class of techniques in modern machine learning. However, past work on active learning has largely overlooked latent variable models, which play a vital role in neuroscience, psychology, and a variety of other engineering and scientific disciplines. Here we address this gap by proposing a novel framework for maximum-mutual-information input selection for discrete latent variable regression models. We first apply our method to a class of models known as mixtures of linear regressions (MLR). While it is well known that active learning confers no advantage for linear-gaussian regression models, we use Fisher information to show analytically that active learning can nevertheless achieve large gains for mixtures of such models, and we validate this improvement using both simulations and real-world data. We then consider a powerful class of temporally structured latent variable models given by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with generalized linear model (GLM) observations, which has recently been used to identify discrete states from animal decision-making data. We show that our method substantially reduces the amount of data needed to fit GLM-HMMs and outperforms a variety of approximate methods based on variational and amortized inference. Infomax learning for latent variable models thus offers a powerful approach for characterizing temporally structured latent states, with a wide variety of applications in neuroscience and beyond.},

	abstract = {Significance
            To obtain rewards in changing and uncertain environments, animals must adapt their behavior. We found that mouse choice and trial-to-trial switching behavior in a dynamic and probabilistic two-choice task could be modeled by equivalent theoretical, algorithmic, and descriptive models. These models capture components of evidence accumulation, choice history bias, and stochasticity in mouse behavior. Furthermore, they reveal that mice adapt their behavior in different environmental contexts by modulating their level of stickiness to their previous choice. Despite deviating from the behavior of a theoretically ideal observer, the empirical models achieve comparable levels of near-maximal reward. These results make predictions to guide interrogation of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision-making strategies.
          , 
            In probabilistic and nonstationary environments, individuals must use internal and external cues to flexibly make decisions that lead to desirable outcomes. To gain insight into the process by which animals choose between actions, we trained mice in a task with time-varying reward probabilities. In our implementation of such a two-armed bandit task, thirsty mice use information about recent action and action–outcome histories to choose between two ports that deliver water probabilistically. Here we comprehensively modeled choice behavior in this task, including the trial-to-trial changes in port selection, i.e., action switching behavior. We find that mouse behavior is, at times, deterministic and, at others, apparently stochastic. The behavior deviates from that of a theoretically optimal agent performing Bayesian inference in a hidden Markov model (HMM). We formulate a set of models based on logistic regression, reinforcement learning, and sticky Bayesian inference that we demonstrate are mathematically equivalent and that accurately describe mouse behavior. The switching behavior of mice in the task is captured in each model by a stochastic action policy, a history-dependent representation of action value, and a tendency to repeat actions despite incoming evidence. The models parsimoniously capture behavior across different environmental conditionals by varying the stickiness parameter, and like the mice, they achieve nearly maximal reward rates. These results indicate that mouse behavior reaches near-maximal performance with reduced action switching and can be described by a set of equivalent models with a small number of relatively fixed parameters.},

            We used a dynamical systems perspective to understand decision-related neural activity, a fundamentally unresolved problem. This perspective posits that time-varying neural activity is described by a state equation with an initial condition and evolves in time by combining at each time step, recurrent activity and inputs. We hypothesized various dynamical mechanisms of decisions, simulated them in models to derive predictions, and evaluated these predictions by examining firing rates of neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of monkeys performing a perceptual decision-making task. Prestimulus neural activity (i.e., the initial condition) predicted poststimulus neural trajectories, covaried with RT and the outcome of the previous trial, but not with choice. Poststimulus dynamics depended on both the sensory evidence and initial condition, with easier stimuli and fast initial conditions leading to the fastest choice-related dynamics. Together, these results suggest that initial conditions combine with sensory evidence to induce decision-related dynamics in PMd.},

            Humans’ ability to adapt and learn relies on reflecting on past performance. These experiences form latent representations called internal states that induce movement variability that improves how we interact with our environment. Our study uncovered temporal dynamics and neural substrates of two states from ten subjects implanted with intracranial depth electrodes while they performed a goal-directed motor task with physical perturbations. We identified two internal states using state-space models: one tracking past errors and the other past perturbations. These states influenced reaction times and speed errors, revealing how subjects strategize from trial history. Using local field potentials from over 100 brain regions, we found large-scale brain networks such as the dorsal attention and default mode network modulate visuospatial attention based on recent performance and environmental feedback. Notably, these networks were more prominent in higher-performing subjects, emphasizing their role in improving motor performance by regulating movement variability through internal states.},

During external mode, perception aligns more closely with the external sensory information, whereas internal mode is characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history. Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are enabled by 2 interlinked factors: (i) the integration of subsequent inputs over time and (ii) slow antiphase oscillations in the impact of external sensory information versus internal predictions that are provided by perceptual history.

            Trial history biases and lapses are two of the most common suboptimalities observed during perceptual decision-making. These suboptimalities are routinely assumed to arise from distinct processes. However, previous work has suggested that they covary in their prevalence and that their proposed neural substrates overlap. Here we demonstrate that during decision-making, history biases and apparent lapses can both arise from a common cognitive process that is optimal under mistaken beliefs that the world is changing i.e. nonstationary. This corresponds to an accumulation-to-bound model with history-dependent updates to the initial state of the accumulator. We test our model’s predictions about the relative prevalence of history biases and lapses, and show that they are robustly borne out in two distinct decision-making datasets of male rats, including data from a novel reaction time task. Our model improves the ability to precisely predict decision-making dynamics within and across trials, by positing a process through which agents can generate quasi-stochastic choices.},

Since FAs are, at heart, reports, they must meet two criteria to serve as an experimental proxy for hallucinations: ﬁrst, FAs should reﬂect perceptual states that are characterized by speciﬁc contents10–12 (criterion 1). Second, FAs should occur on a timescale compatible with the temporal dynamics of hallucinations13,14 (criterion 2). In this work, we combined a classiﬁcation image approach15 with hidden Markov models16 to show that FAs can match the perceptual and temporal characteristics of hallucinations. We asked healthy human participants to discriminate visual stimuli from noise and found that FAs were more likely to occur during an internal mode of sensory processing, a minute-long state of the brain during which perception is strongly biased toward previous experiences17 (serial dependency). Our results suggest that hallucinations are driven by dynamic predictive templates that transform noise into transient, coherent, and meaningful perceptual experiences.},

	title = {Inferring learning rules from animal decision-making},
	abstract = {How do animals learn? This remains an elusive question in neuroscience. Whereas reinforcement learning often focuses on the design of algorithms that enable artiﬁcial agents to efﬁciently learn new tasks, here we develop a modeling framework to directly infer the empirical learning rules that animals use to acquire new behaviors. Our method efﬁciently infers the trial-to-trial changes in an animal’s policy, and decomposes those changes into a learning component and a noise component. Speciﬁcally, this allows us to: (i) compare different learning rules and objective functions that an animal may be using to update its policy; (ii) estimate distinct learning rates for different parameters of an animal’s policy; (iii) identify variations in learning across cohorts of animals; and (iv) uncover trial-to-trial changes that are not captured by normative learning rules. After validating our framework on simulated choice data, we applied our model to data from rats and mice learning perceptual decision-making tasks. We found that certain learning rules were far more capable of explaining trial-to-trial changes in an animal’s policy. Whereas the average contribution of the conventional REINFORCE learning rule to the policy update for mice learning the International Brain Laboratory’s task was just 30\%, we found that adding baseline parameters allowed the learning rule to explain 92\% of the animals’ policy updates under our model. Intriguingly, the best-ﬁtting learning rates and baseline values indicate that an animal’s policy update, at each trial, does not occur in the direction that maximizes expected reward. Understanding how an animal transitions from chance-level to high-accuracy performance when learning a new task not only provides neuroscientists with insight into their animals, but also provides concrete examples of biological learning algorithms to the machine learning community.},

Several algorithms are able to search, score, and assign peptides to large MS/MS datasets.

We present a novel probabilistic scoring algorithm called Context-Sensitive Peptide Identiﬁcation (CSPI) based on highly ﬂexible Input-Output Hidden Markov Models (IO-HMM) that capture the inﬂuence of peptide physicochemical properties on their observed MS/MS spectra. We use several local and global properties of peptides and their fragment ions from literature. Comparison with two popular algorithms, Crux (re-implementation of SEQUEST) and X!Tandem, on multiple datasets of varying complexity, shows that peptide identiﬁcation scores from our models are able to achieve greater discrimination between true and false peptides, identifying up to *25\% more peptides at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 1\%. We evaluated two alternative normalization schemes for fragment ion-intensities, a global rank-based and a local window-based. Our results indicate the importance of appropriate normalization methods for learning superior models. Further, combining our scores with Crux using a state-of-the-art procedure, Percolator, we demonstrate the utility of using scoring features from intensity-based models, identifying *4-8 \% additional identiﬁcations over Percolator at 1\% FDR. IO-HMMs offer a scalable and ﬂexible framework with several modeling choices to learn complex patterns embedded in MS/MS data.},

	abstract = {The operation of a variety of natural or man-made systems subject to uncertainty is maintained within a range of safe behavior through run-time sensing of the system state and control actions selected according to some strategy. When the system is observed from an external perspective, the control strategy may not be known and it should rather be reconstructed by joint observation of the applied control actions and the corresponding evolution of the system state. This is largely hurdled by limitations in the sensing of the system state and different levels of noise. We address the problem of optimal selection of control actions for a stochastic system with unknown dynamics operating under a controller with unknown strategy, for which we can observe trajectories made of the sequence of control actions and noisy observations of the system state which are labeled by the exact value of some reward functions. To this end, we present an approach to train an Input–Output Hidden Markov Model (IO-HMM) as the generative stochastic model that describes the state dynamics of a POMDP by the application of a novel optimization objective adopted from the literate. The learning task is hurdled by two restrictions: the only available sensed data are the limited number of trajectories of applied actions, noisy observations of the system state, and system state; and, the high failure costs prevent interaction with the online environment, preventing exploratory testing. Traditionally, stochastic generative models have been used to learn the underlying system dynamics and select appropriate actions in the deﬁned task. However, current state of the art techniques, in which the state dynamics of the POMDP is ﬁrst learned and then strategies are optimized over it, frequently fail because the model that best ﬁts the data may not be well suited for controlling. By using the aforementioned optimization objective, we try to to tackle the problems related to model mis-speciﬁcation. The proposed methodology is illustrated in a scenario of failure avoidance for a multi component system. The quality of the decision making is evaluated by using the collected reward on the test data and compared against the previous literature usual approach.},

The PPGM model consists of two components: a Bayesian network of patient attributes and a temporal model of pathogenetic mechanisms. The model structure was reconstructed from expert knowledge elicitation, and its parameters were estimated using Variational Expectation­ Maximization algorithms. We benchmarked our model with two well-established hidden Markov models (HMMs) – Input-output HMM (IO-HMM) and Switching Auto-Regressive HMM (SAR­ HMM) – to evaluate the computational costs, forecasting performance, and execution time. Two case studies on Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) were used to validate the model. While the performance of the parameter learning step was equivalent to those of IO-HMM and SAR-HMM models, our model forecasting ability was outperforming those two models. The merits of the PPGM model are its representation capability to capture the dynamics of pathogenesis and perform medical inferences and its interpretability for physicians. The model has been used to perform medical queries and forecast the acute onset of OSA and PAF.

	title = {Efficient inference for time-varying behavior during learning},
	abstract = {The process of learning new behaviors over time is a problem of great interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, most standard analyses of animal training data either treat behavior as fixed or track only coarse performance statistics (e.g., accuracy, bias), providing limited insight into the evolution of the policies governing behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic psychophysical model that efficiently tracks trial-to-trial changes in behavior over the course of training. Our model consists of a dynamic logistic regression model, parametrized by a set of time-varying weights that express dependence on sensory stimuli as well as task-irrelevant covariates, such as stimulus, choice, and answer history. Our implementation scales to large behavioral datasets, allowing us to infer 500K parameters (e.g., 10 weights over 50K trials) in minutes on a desktop computer. We optimize hyperparameters governing how rapidly each weight evolves over time using the decoupled Laplace approximation, an efficient method for maximizing marginal likelihood in non-conjugate models. To illustrate performance, we apply our method to psychophysical data from both rats and human subjects learning a delayed sensory discrimination task. The model successfully tracks the psychophysical weights of rats over the course of training, capturing day-to-day and trial-to-trial fluctuations that underlie changes in performance, choice bias, and dependencies on task history. Finally, we investigate why rats frequently make mistakes on easy trials, and suggest that apparent lapses can be explained by sub-optimal weighting of known task covariates.},

Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, remains unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on the cognitive requirements of a task. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that—even within a single task—the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the demands imposed by a task, as well as the internal state of mice when performing a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.},

Little is known about the factors that underlie these changes in task performance. We hypothesize that these decision-making dynamics can be predicted by externally observable measures, such as uninstructed movements and changes in arousal. Here, combining behavioral experiments in mice with computational modeling, we uncovered lawful relationships between transitions in strategic task performance states and an animal’s arousal and uninstructed movements. Using hidden Markov models applied to behavioral choices during sensory discrimination tasks, we found that animals fluctuate between minutes-long optimal, sub-optimal and disengaged performance states. Optimal state epochs were predicted by intermediate levels, and reduced variability, of pupil diameter, along with reduced variability in face movements and locomotion. Our results demonstrate that externally observable uninstructed behaviors can predict optimal performance states, and suggest mice regulate their arousal during optimal performance.},

            While judging their sensory environments, decision-makers seem to use the uncertainty about their choices to guide adjustments of their subsequent behaviour. One possible source of these behavioural adjustments is arousal: decision uncertainty might drive the brain’s arousal systems, which control global brain state and might thereby shape subsequent decision-making. Here, we measure pupil diameter, a proxy for central arousal state, in human observers performing a perceptual choice task of varying difficulty. Pupil dilation, after choice but before external feedback, reflects three hallmark signatures of decision uncertainty derived from a computational model. This increase in pupil-linked arousal boosts observers’ tendency to alternate their choice on the subsequent trial. We conclude that decision uncertainty drives rapid changes in pupil-linked arousal state, which shape the serial correlation structure of ongoing choice behaviour.},

	abstract = {Extracting time-varying latent variables from computational cognitive models is a key step in model-based neural analysis, which aims to understand the neural correlates of cognitive processes. However, existing methods only allow researchers to infer latent variables that explain subjects’ behavior in a relatively small class of cognitive models. For example, a broad class of relevant cognitive models with analytically intractable likelihood is currently out of reach from standard techniques, based on Maximum a Posteriori parameter estimation. Here, we present an approach that extends neural Bayes estimation to learn a direct mapping between experimental data and the targeted latent variable space using recurrent neural networks and simulated datasets. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance in inferring latent variable sequences in both tractable and intractable models. Furthermore, the approach is generalizable across different computational models and is adaptable for both continuous and discrete latent spaces. We then demonstrate its applicability in real world datasets. Our work underscores that combining recurrent neural networks and simulation-based inference to identify latent variable sequences can enable researchers to access a wider class of cognitive models for model-based neural analyses, and thus test a broader set of theories.},

However, this switching behavior has not yet been characterized in non-stationary environments, and the factors that govern switching remain unknown. Here we address these questions using an internal state model with input-driven transitions. Our approach relies on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with two sets of per-state generalized linear models (GLMs): a set of Bernoulli GLMs for modeling the animal state- and stimulus-dependent choice on each trial, and a multinomial GLM for modeling input-dependent transitions between states. We used this model to analyze a dataset from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), in which mice performed a binary decision-making task with non-stationary stimulus statistics. We found that mouse behavior in this task was accurately described by a four-state model. This model contained two "engaged" states, in which performance was good despite slight left and right biases, and two "disengaged" states, where performance was low and exhibited with larger left and right biases, respectively. Our analyses revealed that mice preferentially used left-bias strategies during left-bias stimulus blocks, and right-bias strategies during right-bias stimulus blocks, meaning that they could achieve reasonably high performance even in disengaged states simply by biasing choice toward the side with greater prior probability. Our model showed that past choices and past stimuli predicted transitions between left- and right-bias states, while past rewards predicted transitions between engaged and disengaged states. In particular, greater past reward predicted transition to disengaged states, suggesting that disengagement may be associated with satiety.},

Several approaches have been proposed in the past 25 years to solve this problem. These approaches, however, have provided only partial solutions that apply in only some special cases, and the problem, in general, remains largely unresolved.

Instead of integrating the evidence provided by all stimuli, participants actively discarded as much as a third of stimuli. This conditional belief updating strategy shows good test-retest reliability, correlates with perceptual confidence, and explains human behavior better than previously described strategies.

            A fundamental tenet of animal behavior is that decision-making involves multiple ‘controllers.’ Initially, behavior is goal-directed, driven by desired outcomes, shifting later to habitual control, where cues trigger actions independent of motivational state. Clark Hull’s question from 1943 still resonates today: “Is this transition abrupt, or is it gradual and progressive?”
            1
            Despite a century-long belief in gradual transitions, this question remains unanswered
            2,3
            as current methods cannot disambiguate goal-directed versus habitual control in real-time. Here, we introduce a novel ‘volitional engagement’ approach, motivating animals by palatability rather than biological need. Offering less palatable water in the home cage
            4,5
            reduced motivation to ‘work’ for plain water in an auditory discrimination task when compared to water-restricted animals. Using quantitative behavior and computational modeling
            6
            , we found that palatability-driven animals learned to discriminate as quickly as water-restricted animals but exhibited state-like fluctuations when responding to the reward-predicting cue—reflecting goal-directed behavior. These fluctuations spontaneously and abruptly ceased after thousands of trials, with animals now always responding to the reward-predicting cue. In line with habitual control, post-transition behavior displayed motor automaticity, decreased error sensitivity (assessed via pupillary responses), and insensitivity to outcome devaluation. Bilateral lesions of the habit-related dorsolateral striatum
            7
            blocked transitions to habitual behavior. Thus, ‘volitional engagement’ reveals spontaneous and abrupt transitions from goal-directed to habitual behavior, suggesting the involvement of a higher-level process that arbitrates between the two.},

	abstract = {Computational cognitive modeling is an important tool for understanding the processes supporting human and animal decision-making. Choice data in decision-making tasks are inherently noisy, and separating noise from signal can improve the quality of computational modeling. Common approaches to model decision noise often assume constant levels of noise or exploration throughout learning (e.g., the 𝜖-softmax policy). However, this assumption is not guaranteed to hold – for example, a subject might disengage and lapse into an inattentive phase for a series of trials in the middle of otherwise low-noise performance. Here, we introduce a new, computationally inexpensive method to dynamically estimate the levels of noise fluctuations in choice behavior, under a model assumption that the agent can transition between two discrete latent states (e.g., fully engaged and random). Using simulations, we show that modeling noise levels dynamically instead of statically can substantially improve model fit and parameter estimation, especially in the presence of long periods of noisy behavior, such as prolonged lapses of attention. We further demonstrate the empirical benefits of dynamic noise estimation at the individual and group levels by validating it on four published datasets featuring diverse populations, tasks, and models. Based on the theoretical and empirical evaluation of the method reported in the current work, we expect that dynamic noise estimation will improve modeling in many decision-making paradigms over the static noise estimation method currently used in the modeling literature, while keeping additional model complexity and assumptions minimal.},

	abstract = {In reversal learning tasks, the behavior of humans and animals is often assumed to be uniform within single experimental sessions to facilitate data analysis and model fitting. However, behavior of agents can display substantial variability in single experimental sessions, as they execute different blocks of trials with different transition dynamics. Here, we observed that in a deterministic reversal learning task, mice display noisy and sub-optimal choice transitions even at the expert stages of learning. We investigated two sources of the sub-optimality in the behavior. First, we found that mice exhibit a high lapse rate during task execution, as they reverted to unrewarded directions after choice transitions. Second, we unexpectedly found that a majority of mice did not execute a uniform strategy, but rather mixed between several behavioral modes with different transition dynamics. We quantified the use of such mixtures with a state-space model, block Hidden Markov Model (block HMM), to dissociate the mixtures of dynamic choice transitions in individual blocks of trials. Additionally, we found that blockHMM transition modes in rodent behavior can be accounted for by two different types of behavioral algorithms, model-free or inference-based learning, that might be used to solve the task. Combining these approaches, we found that mice used a mixture of both exploratory, model-free strategies and deterministic, inference-based behavior in the task, explaining their overall noisy choice sequences. Together, our combined computational approach highlights intrinsic sources of noise in rodent reversal learning behavior and provides a richer description of behavior than conventional techniques, while uncovering the hidden states that underlie the block-by-block transitions.},

We investigated the effect of background white noise (WN) on tuning properties of neurons in mouse A1 and its impact on discrimination performance in a go/no-go task. We ﬁnd that WN suppresses the activity of A1 neurons, which surprisingly increases the discriminability of tones spectrally close to each other. To conﬁrm the involvement of A1, we optogenetically excited parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons in A1, which have similar effects as WN on both tuning properties and frequency discrimination. A population model suggests that the suppression of A1 tuning curves increases frequency selectivity and thereby improves discrimination. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the cortical representation of pure tones adapts during noise to improve sensory acuity.},

	abstract = {Since the 1990s, the study of inherited hearing disorders, mostly those detected at birth, in the prelingual period or in young adults, has led to the identification of their causal genes. The genes responsible for more than 140 isolated (non-syndromic) and about 400 syndromic forms of deafness have already been discovered. Studies of mouse models of these monogenic forms of deafness have provided considerable insight into the molecular mechanisms of hearing, particularly those involved in the development and/or physiology of the auditory sensory organ, the cochlea. In parallel, studies of these models have also made it possible to decipher the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hearing impairment. This has led a number of laboratories to investigate the potential of gene therapy for curing these forms of deafness. Proof-of-concept has now been obtained for the treatment of several forms of deafness in mouse models, paving the way for clinical trials of cochlear gene therapy in patients in the near future. Nevertheless, peripheral deafness may also be associated with central auditory dysfunctions and may extend well beyond the auditory system itself, as a consequence of alterations to the encoded sensory inputs or involvement of the causal deafness genes in the development and/or functioning of central auditory circuits. Investigating the diversity, causes and underlying mechanisms of these central dysfunctions, the ways in which they could impede the expected benefits of hearing restoration by peripheral gene therapy, and determining how these problems could be remedied is becoming a research field in its own right. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the central deficits associated with genetic forms of deafness.},

	abstract = {During sensory-guided behavior, an animal’s decision-making dynamics unfold through sequences of distinct performance states, even while stimulus-reward contingencies remain static. Little is known about the factors that underlie these changes in task performance. We hypothesize that these decision-making dynamics can be predicted by externally observable measures, such as uninstructed movements and changes in arousal. Here, combining behavioral experiments in mice with computational modeling, we uncovered lawful relationships between transitions in strategic task performance states and an animal’s arousal and uninstructed movements. Using hidden Markov models applied to behavioral choices during sensory discrimination tasks, we found that animals fluctuate between minutes-long optimal, sub-optimal and disengaged performance states. Optimal state epochs were predicted by intermediate levels, and reduced variability, of pupil diameter, along with reduced variability in face movements and locomotion. Our results demonstrate that externally observable uninstructed behaviors can predict optimal performance states, and suggest mice regulate their arousal during optimal performance.},

To understand the neural signature of these states, we performed cortex-wide measurements of neural activity in mice making auditory decisions. The trial-averaged magnitude of neural activity was similar in the two states. However, the trial-to-trial variance in neural activity was higher during disengagement. To understand this increased variance, we trained separate linear encoding models on neural data from each state. The models demonstrated that although task variables and task-aligned movements impacted neural activity similarly during the two states, movements that are independent of task events explained more variance during disengagement. Behavioral analyses uncovered that during disengagement, movements become uncoupled to task events. Taken together, these results argue that the neural signature of disengagement, though obscured in trial-averaged neural activity, is evident in trial-to-trial variability driven by changing patterns of spontaneous movements.},

	abstract = {Recent work has revealed that mice do not rely on a stable strategy during perceptual decision-making, but switch between multiple strategies within a single session [1, 2]. However, this switching behavior has not yet been characterized in non-stationary environments, and the factors that govern switching remain unknown. Here we address these questions using an internal state model with input-driven transitions. Our approach relies on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with two sets of per-state generalized linear models (GLMs): a set of Bernoulli GLMs for modeling the animal state- and stimulus-dependent choice on each trial, and a multinomial GLM for modeling input-dependent transitions between states. We used this model to analyze a dataset from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), in which mice performed a binary decision-making task with non-stationary stimulus statistics. We found that mouse behavior in this task was accurately described by a four-state model. This model contained two "engaged" states, in which performance was good despite slight left and right biases, and two "disengaged" states, where performance was low and exhibited with larger left and right biases, respectively. Our analyses revealed that mice preferentially used left-bias strategies during left-bias stimulus blocks, and right-bias strategies during right-bias stimulus blocks, meaning that they could achieve reasonably high performance even in disengaged states simply by biasing choice toward the side with greater prior probability. Our model showed that past choices and past stimuli predicted transitions between left- and right-bias states, while past rewards predicted transitions between engaged and disengaged states. In particular, greater past reward predicted transition to disengaged states, suggesting that disengagement may be associated with satiety.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that during perceptual decision-making tasks, animals frequently alternate between different internal states or strategies. However, the question of how or when these emerge during learning remains an important open problem. Does an animal alternate between multiple strategies from the very start of training, or only after extensive exposure to a task? Here we address this question by developing a dynamic latent state model, which we applied to training data from mice learning to perform a visual decision-making task. Remarkably, we found that mice exhibited distinct “engaged” and “biased” states even during early training, with multiple states apparent from the second training session onward. Moreover, our model revealed that the gradual improvement in task performance over the course of training arose from a combination of two factors: (1) increased sensitivity to stimuli across all states; and (2) increased proportion of time spent in a higher-accuracy “engaged” state relative to biased or disengaged states. These findings highlight the power of our approach for characterizing the temporal evolution of multiple strategies across learning.},

	abstract = {Extracting time-varying latent variables from computational cognitive models is a key step in model-based neural analysis, which aims to understand the neural correlates of cognitive processes. However, existing methods only allow researchers to infer latent variables that explain subjects’ behavior in a relatively small class of cognitive models. For example, a broad class of relevant cognitive models with analytically intractable likelihood is currently out of reach from standard techniques, based on Maximum a Posteriori parameter estimation. Here, we present an approach that extends neural Bayes estimation to learn a direct mapping between experimental data and the targeted latent variable space using recurrent neural networks and simulated datasets. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance in inferring latent variable sequences in both tractable and intractable models. Furthermore, the approach is generalizable across different computational models and is adaptable for both continuous and discrete latent spaces. We then demonstrate its applicability in real world datasets. Our work underscores that combining recurrent neural networks and simulation-based inference to identify latent variable sequences can enable researchers to access a wider class of cognitive models for model-based neural analyses, and thus test a broader set of theories.},

The choice of design for a GLM is a very important task in the development and building of an adequate model. However, one major problem that handicaps the construction of a GLM design is its dependence on the unknown parameters of the ﬁtted model. Several approaches have been proposed in the past 25 years to solve this problem. These approaches, however, have provided only partial solutions that apply in only some special cases, and the problem, in general, remains largely unresolved. The purpose of this article is to focus attention on the aforementioned dependence problem. We provide a survey of various existing techniques dealing with the dependence problem. This survey includes discussions concerning locally optimal designs, sequential designs, Bayesian designs and the quantile dispersion graph approach for comparing designs for GLMs.},

Our goal was to systematically review the papers reporting acoustic features of prosodic production in RHD, to identify strengths and weaknesses in this field, suggest guidelines for future research, and to support cumulative research by estimating the meta-analytic effect size of those features. We queried PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using the following combination of search terms: (prosody OR intonation OR inflection OR intensity OR pitch OR fundamental frequency OR speech rate OR voice quality) AND (RHD OR right hemisphere) AND (stroke) AND (acoustic). Standardized mean differences were extracted from all papers meeting inclusion criteria, and aggregated effect sizes were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian regression models. Sixteen papers met our inclusion criteria. We did not find strong evidence in the literature to indicate that the prosodic productions of people with RHD is substantially different from that of NBD controls, when measured in terms of acoustic features. However, the acoustic features of productions by people with RHD did differ from those of participants with NBD and LHD in some ways, notably in F0 variation and pause duration. Prosody type (emotional vs. linguistic) had very little effect. Taken together, currently available data show only a weak effect of RHD on prosody production. However, more accurate analyses are hindered by small sample sizes, lack of detail on lesion location, and divergent measuring techniques. Cumulative open science practices are recommended to overcome these issues.},

Method: Eighty-four participants completed the Modern Cookie Theft picture description within 5 days of right hemisphere stroke. Descriptions were analyzed for multiple microlinguistic characteristics. Medical charts were retrospectively reviewed for documented presence of cognitive impairment.
Results: Individuals with acute right hemisphere stroke produced fewer content units, total syllables, and lower left–right content unit ratios compared to controls, indicating a paucity of informativeness. Presence of cognitive impairment was associated with fewer content units produced.
Conclusions: Multiple measures of microlinguistic discourse characteristics differentiated adults with right hemisphere stroke from controls, highlighting variations in both the quantity and quality of connected speech. Findings continue to underscore the contribution and correlation between cognitive skills and discourse performance. Future work is needed to assess the relationship between particular cognitive domains and discourse production as well as to investigate longitudinal changes to discourse production during stroke recovery.},

However, it is unclear whether these particularities are associated with unusual mental representations of vocal emotions. The objective of the current study was to explore the mental representation of vocal smile in autistic adults. Twenty-nine autistic (ASD) and 29 neurotypical (NT) adults performed an auditory reverse correlation task, that affords the opportunity to extract acoustic features of mental representation and their variability. Most ASD participants (17) based their representation of vocal smile on similar acoustic features as NT participants and no difference in the level of internal noise was observed. However, comparisons between groups revealed a more typical representation in NT than in ASD. Subsequent cluster analysis revealed that the difference of typicality was explained by a small subset of ASD participants displaying different representations. A correlation analysis also revealed that the typicality was positively correlated with the empathetic level within both groups. While most autistic adults have a preserved mental representation of vocal smiles, a subset shows less robust and typical representations, which is linked to lower levels of empathy. This study highlights that the perception of vocal smiles in autism is more nuanced than previously reported, with empathy playing a substantial role in shaping these mental representations.},

	abstract = {Significance
            To obtain rewards in changing and uncertain environments, animals must adapt their behavior. We found that mouse choice and trial-to-trial switching behavior in a dynamic and probabilistic two-choice task could be modeled by equivalent theoretical, algorithmic, and descriptive models. These models capture components of evidence accumulation, choice history bias, and stochasticity in mouse behavior. Furthermore, they reveal that mice adapt their behavior in different environmental contexts by modulating their level of stickiness to their previous choice. Despite deviating from the behavior of a theoretically ideal observer, the empirical models achieve comparable levels of near-maximal reward. These results make predictions to guide interrogation of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision-making strategies.
          , 
            In probabilistic and nonstationary environments, individuals must use internal and external cues to flexibly make decisions that lead to desirable outcomes. To gain insight into the process by which animals choose between actions, we trained mice in a task with time-varying reward probabilities. In our implementation of such a two-armed bandit task, thirsty mice use information about recent action and action–outcome histories to choose between two ports that deliver water probabilistically. Here we comprehensively modeled choice behavior in this task, including the trial-to-trial changes in port selection, i.e., action switching behavior. We find that mouse behavior is, at times, deterministic and, at others, apparently stochastic. The behavior deviates from that of a theoretically optimal agent performing Bayesian inference in a hidden Markov model (HMM). We formulate a set of models based on logistic regression, reinforcement learning, and sticky Bayesian inference that we demonstrate are mathematically equivalent and that accurately describe mouse behavior. The switching behavior of mice in the task is captured in each model by a stochastic action policy, a history-dependent representation of action value, and a tendency to repeat actions despite incoming evidence. The models parsimoniously capture behavior across different environmental conditionals by varying the stickiness parameter, and like the mice, they achieve nearly maximal reward rates. These results indicate that mouse behavior reaches near-maximal performance with reduced action switching and can be described by a set of equivalent models with a small number of relatively fixed parameters.},

Evidence will be presented that provides a much broader perspective of emotions by embracing the concept that emotions can be classiﬁed into primary and social types and that hemispheric lateralization is better explained by the Emotion-type Hypothesis (ETH).

These neurofunctional characteristics in children with ADHD, ADD and dyslexia are linked to distinct differences in music perception. Group-speciﬁc differences in the musical performance of patients with ADHD, ADD and dyslexia have not been investigated in detail so far. We investigated the musical performance and neurophysiological correlates of 21 adolescents with dyslexia, 19 with ADHD, 28 with ADD and 28 age-matched, unaffected controls using a music performance assessment scale and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Musical experts independently assessed pitch and rhythmic accuracy, intonation, improvisation skills and musical expression. Compared to dyslexic adolescents, controls as well as adolescents with ADHD and ADD performed better in rhythmic reproduction, rhythmic improvisation and musical expression. Controls were signiﬁcantly better in rhythmic reproduction than adolescents with ADD and scored higher in rhythmic and pitch improvisation than adolescents with ADHD. Adolescents with ADD and controls scored better in pitch reproduction than dyslexic adolescents. In pitch improvisation, the ADD group performed better than the ADHD group, and controls scored better than dyslexic adolescents. Discriminant analysis revealed that rhythmic improvisation and musical expression discriminate the dyslexic group from controls and adolescents with ADHD and ADD. A second discriminant analysis based on MEG variables showed that absolute P1 latency asynchrony {\textbar}R-L{\textbar} distinguishes the control group from the disorder groups best, while P1 and N1 latencies averaged across hemispheres separate the control, ADD and ADHD groups from the dyslexic group. Furthermore, rhythmic improvisation was negatively correlated with auditory-evoked P1 and N1 latencies, pointing in the following direction: the earlier the P1 and N1 latencies (mean), the better the rhythmic improvisation. These ﬁndings provide novel insight into the differences between music processing and performance in adolescents with and without neurodevelopmental disorders. A better understanding of these differences may help to develop tailored preventions or therapeutic interventions.},

To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online.

	abstract = {Given recent experimental results suggesting that neural circuits may evolve through multiple ﬁring states, we develop a framework for estimating state-dependent neural response properties from spike-train data. We modify the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to incorporate stimulus-driven, non-Poisson point process observations. For maximal ﬂexibility, we allow external, time-varying stimuli and the neurons’ own spike histories to drive both the spiking behavior in each state and the transitioning behavior between states. We employ an appropriately modiﬁed expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The expectation step is solved by the standard forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. The maximization step reduces to a set of separable concave optimization problems if the model is restricted slightly. We ﬁrst test our algorithm on simulated data and are able both to fully recover the parameters used to generate the data and to accurately recapitulate the sequence of hidden states. We then apply our algorithm to a recently published data set in which the observed neuronal ensembles displayed multi-state behavior and show that inclusion of spike-history information signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁt of the model. Additionally, we show that a simple reformulation of the state-space of the underlying Markov chain allows us to implement a hybrid half-multistate/half-histogram model which may be more appropriate for capturing the complexity of certain data sets than either a simple HMM or a simple peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) model alone.},

	abstract = {In the auditory system, the stimulus-response properties of single neurons are often described in terms of the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), a linear kernel relating the spectrogram of the sound stimulus to the instantaneous firing rate of the neuron. Several algorithms have been used to estimate STRFs from responses to natural stimuli; these algorithms differ in their functional models, cost functions, and regularization methods. Here, we characterize the stimulusresponse function of auditory neurons using a generalized linear model (GLM). In this model, each cell’s input is described by: 1) a stimulus filter (STRF); and 2) a post-spike filter, which captures dependencies on the neuron’s spiking history. The output of the model is given by a series of spike trains rather than instantaneous firing rate, allowing the prediction of spike train responses to novel stimuli. We fit the model by maximum penalized likelihood to the spiking activity of zebra finch auditory midbrain neurons in response to conspecific vocalizations (songs) and modulation limited (ml) noise. We compare this model to normalized reverse correlation (NRC), the traditional method for STRF estimation, in terms of predictive power and the basic tuning properties of the estimated STRFs. We find that a GLM with a sparse prior predicts novel responses to both stimulus classes significantly better than NRC. Importantly, we find that STRFs from the two models derived from the same responses can differ substantially and that GLM STRFs are more consistent between stimulus classes than NRC STRFs. These results suggest that a GLM with a sparse prior provides a more accurate characterization of spectrotemporal tuning than does the NRC method when responses to complex sounds are studied in these neurons.},

At an early stage, or a preattentive stage, the right brain hemisphere is shown to dominate the auditory processing of tones, including lexical tones. However, little is known about the influence of brain damage on the labor division of the brain hemispheres for the auditory processing of linguistic tones. Here, we demonstrate swapped dominance of brain hemispheres at the preattentive stage of auditory processing of Chinese lexical tones after a stroke in the right temporal lobe (RTL). In this study, we frequently presented lexical tones to a group of patients with a stroke in the RTL and infrequently varied the tones to create an auditory contrast. The contrast evoked a mismatch negativity response, which indexes auditory processing at the preattentive stage. In the participants with a stroke in the RTL, the mismatch negativity response was lateralized to the left side, in contrast to the right lateralization pattern in the control participants. The swapped dominance of brain hemispheres indicates that the RTL is a core area for early-stage auditory tonal processing. Our study indicates the necessity of rehabilitating tonal processing functions for tonal language speakers who suffer an RTL injury.},

Here we present a computational model, lab-based, and online visual identification experiments to find corroborating evidence for this hypothesis in individuals without a formal ASD diagnosis. Our modeling predicts that artificially increasing noise results in SR for individuals with low internal noise (e.g., neurotypical), however not for those with higher internal noise (e.g., autistic, or neurotypical individuals with higher autistic traits). It also predicts that at low stimulus noise, individuals with higher internal noise outperform those with lower internal noise. We tested these predictions using visual identification tasks among participants from the general population with autistic traits measured by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). While all participants showed SR in the lab-based experiment, this did not support our model strongly. In the online experiment, significant SR was not found, however participants with higher AQ scores outperformed those with lower AQ scores at low stimulus noise levels, which is consistent with our modeling. In conclusion, our study is the first to investigate the link between SR and superior performance by those with ASD-related traits, and reports limited evidence to support the high neural noise/SR hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Change deafness, the auditory analog to change blindness, occurs when salient, and behaviorally relevant changes to sound sources are missed. Missing signiﬁcant changes in the environment can have serious consequences, however, this effect, has remained little more than a lab phenomenon and a party trick. It is only recently that researchers have begun to explore the nature of these profound errors in change perception. Despite a wealth of examples of the change blindness phenomenon, work on change deafness remains fairly limited. The purpose of the current paper is to review the state of the literature on change deafness and propose an explanation of change deafness that relies on factors related to stimulus information rather than attentional or memory limits. To achieve this, work on across several auditory research domains, including environmental sound classiﬁcation, informational masking, and change deafness are synthesized to present a uniﬁed perspective on the perception of change errors in complex, dynamic sound environments. We hope to extend previous research by describing how it may be possible to predict speciﬁc patters of change perception errors based on varying degrees of similarity in stimulus features and uncertainty about which stimuli and features are important for a given perceptual decision.},

In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated the processing of task-irrelevant and task-relevant pitch and location during discrimination, n-back, and visual tasks. We tested three hypotheses: (1) According to prevailing auditory models, stimulus-dependent processing of pitch and location should be associated with enhanced activations in distinct areas of the anterior and posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG), respectively. (2) Based on our previous studies, task-dependent activation patterns during discrimination and n-back tasks should be similar when these tasks are performed on sounds varying in pitch or location. (3) Previous studies in humans and animals suggest that pitch and location tasks should enhance activations especially in those areas that also show activation enhancements associated with stimulusdependent pitch and location processing, respectively. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found stimulus-dependent sensitivity to pitch and location in anterolateral STG and anterior planum temporale (PT), respectively, in line with the view that these features are processed in separate parallel pathways. Further, task-dependent activations during discrimination and n-back tasks were associated with enhanced activations in anterior/posterior STG and posterior STG/inferior parietal lobule (IPL) irrespective of stimulus features. However, direct comparisons between pitch and location tasks performed on identical sounds revealed no signiﬁcant activation differences. These results suggest that activations during pitch and location tasks are not strongly affected by enhanced stimulus-dependent activations to pitch or location. We also found that activations in PT were strongly modulated by task requirements and that areas in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) showed task-dependent activation modulations, but no systematic activations to pitch or location. Based on these results, we argue that activations during pitch and location tasks cannot be explained by enhanced stimulusspeciﬁc processing alone, but rather that activations in human AC depend in a complex manner on the requirements of the task at hand.},

	abstract = {Individuals with autism typically experience a range of symptoms, including abnormal sensory sensitivities. However, there are conﬂicting reports on the sensory proﬁles that characterize the sensory experience in autism that often depend on the type of stimulus. Here, we examine early auditory processing to simple changes in pitch and later auditory processing of more complex emotional utterances. We measured electroencephalography in 24 adults with autism and 28 controls. First, tones (1046.5Hz/C6, 1108.7Hz/C\#6, or 1244.5Hz/D\#6) were repeated three times or nine times before the pitch changed. Second, utterances of delight or frustration were repeated three or six times before the emotion changed. In response to the simple pitched tones, the autism group exhibited larger mismatch negativity (MMN) after nine standards compared to controls and produced greater trial-to-trial variability (TTV). In response to the prosodic utterances, the autism group showed smaller P3 responses when delight changed to frustration compared to controls. There was no signiﬁcant correlation between ERPs to pitch and ERPs to prosody. Together, this suggests that early auditory processing is hyper-sensitive in autism whereas later processing of prosodic information is hypo-sensitive. The impact the different sensory proﬁles have on perceptual experience in autism may be key to identifying behavioral treatments to reduce symptoms.},

Within subjects, speed and ability are assumed to be constants. Violations of this assumption are generally absorbed in the residual of the model. As a result, within-subject departures from the between-subject speed and ability level remain undetected. These departures may be of interest to the researcher as they reflect differences in the response processes adopted on the items of a test. In this article, we propose a dynamic approach for responses and response times based on hidden Markov modeling to account for within-subject differences in responses and response times. A simulation study is conducted to demonstrate acceptable parameter recovery and acceptable performance of various fit indices in distinguishing between different models. In addition, both a confirmatory and an exploratory application are presented to demonstrate the practical value of the modeling approach.},

	abstract = {The transmission of weak signals through the visual system is limited by internal noise. Its level can be estimated by adding external noise, which increases the variance within the detecting mechanism, causing masking. But experiments with white noise fail to meet three predictions: (a) noise has too small an influence on the slope of the psychometric function, (b) masking occurs even when the noise sample is identical in each two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) interval, and (c) double-pass consistency is too low. We show that much of the energy of 2D white noise masks extends well beyond the pass-band of plausible detecting mechanisms and that this suppresses signal activity. These problems are avoided by restricting the external noise energy to the target mechanisms by introducing a pedestal with a mean contrast of 0\% and independent contrast jitter in each 2AFC interval (termed zero-dimensional [0D] noise). We compared the jitter condition to masking from 2D white noise in double-pass masking and (novel) contrast matching experiments. Zero-dimensional noise produced the strongest masking, greatest double-pass consistency, and no suppression of perceived contrast, consistent with a noisy ideal observer. Deviations from this behavior for 2D white noise were explained by cross-channel suppression with no need to appeal to induced internal noise or uncertainty. We conclude that (a) results from previous experiments using white pixel noise should be re-evaluated and (b) 0D noise provides a cleaner method for investigating internal variability than pixel noise. Ironically then, the best external noise stimulus does not look noisy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE. To determine the relationships among equivalent intrinsic noise (Neq), sampling efﬁciency, and contrast sensitivity (CS) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), where Neq is an estimate of the amount of noise within the visual pathway and sampling efﬁciency represents the subject’s ability to use stimulus information optimally.
METHODS. Participants included 10 patients with RP aged 10 to 54 years, who had visual acuities of 20/40 or better, and 10 visually normal control subjects aged 22 to 65 years. CS was measured for 2-cycles-per-degree Gabor patch targets presented in the absence of noise (CS0) and in ﬁve levels of noise spectral density. Data were ﬁt with a standard linear ampliﬁer model, which provided estimates of Neq and sampling efﬁciency.
RESULTS. CS0 for the patients ranged from normal to as much as a factor of 3 below the lower limit of normal. All 10 patients had abnormally high Neq, including two patients with normal CS0. In comparison, only two patients had lower-than-normal sampling efﬁciency, and these two patients also had below-normal CS0. Log CS0 for the patients was correlated signiﬁcantly with log Neq (r ¼ À0.80, P {\textless} 0.05), but not with log efﬁciency (r ¼ 0.54, P ¼ 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS. Low CS was associated with elevated intrinsic noise in this group of RP patients, but even patients with normal CS had elevated noise levels. The results suggest that CS measurement in both the presence and absence of luminance noise can provide important information about visual dysfunction in RP patients.},

	abstract = {Purpose: We introduce a method for determining the impulse response function (IRF) of the ERG derived from responses to temporal white noise (TWN) stimuli.
Methods: This white noise ERG (wnERG) was recorded in participants with normal trichromatic vision to full-field (Ganzfeld) and 39.38 diameter focal stimuli at mesopic and photopic mean luminances and at different TWN contrasts. The IRF was obtained by cross-correlating the TWN stimulus with the wnERG.
Results: We show that wnERG recordings are highly repeatable, with good signal-tonoise ratio, and do not lead to blink artifacts. The wnERG resembles a flash ERG waveform with an initial negativity (N1) followed by a positivity (P1), with amplitudes that are linearly related to stimulus contrast. These N1 and N1-P1 components showed commonalties in implicit times with the a- and b-waves of flash ERGs. There was a clear transition from rod- to cone-driven wnERGs at {\textasciitilde}1 photopic cd.mÀ2. We infer that oscillatory potentials found with the flash ERG, but not the wnERG, may reflect retinal nonlinearities due to the compression of energy into a short time period during a stimulus flash.
Conclusion: The wnERG provides a new approach to study the physiology of the retina using a stimulation method with adaptation and contrast conditions similar to natural scenes to allow for independent variation of stimulus strength and mean luminance, which is not possible with the conventional flash ERG.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have provided important information regarding how and where pitch is coded and processed in the human brain. Recordings of the frequency-following response (FFR), an electrophysiological measure of neural temporal coding in the brainstem, have shown that the precision of temporal pitch information is dependent on linguistic and musical experience, and can even be modiﬁed by shortterm training. However, the FFR does not seem to represent the output of a pitch extraction process, and this raises questions regarding how the peripheral neural signal is processed to produce a uniﬁed sensation. Since stimuli with a wide variety of spectral and binaural characteristics can produce the same pitch, it has been suggested that there is a place in the ascending auditory pathway at which the representations converge. There is evidence from many different human neuroimaging studies that certain areas of auditory cortex are speciﬁcally sensitive to pitch, although the location is still a matter of debate. Taken together, the results suggest that the initial temporal pitch code in the auditory periphery is converted to a code based on neural ﬁring rate in the brainstem. In the upper brainstem or auditory cortex, the information from the individual harmonics of complex tones is combined to form a general representation of pitch.},

Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational eﬃciency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and eﬃcient estimation of spatially-varying ﬁring rates.},

            Active learning seeks to reduce the amount of data required to fit the parameters of a model, thus forming an important class of techniques in modern machine learning. However, past work on active learning has largely overlooked latent variable models, which play a vital role in neuroscience, psychology, and a variety of other engineering and scientific disciplines. Here we address this gap by proposing a novel framework for maximum-mutual-information input selection for discrete latent variable regression models. We first apply our method to a class of models known as mixtures of linear regressions (MLR). While it is well known that active learning confers no advantage for linear-gaussian regression models, we use Fisher information to show analytically that active learning can nevertheless achieve large gains for mixtures of such models, and we validate this improvement using both simulations and real-world data. We then consider a powerful class of temporally structured latent variable models given by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with generalized linear model (GLM) observations, which has recently been used to identify discrete states from animal decision-making data. We show that our method substantially reduces the amount of data needed to fit GLM-HMMs and outperforms a variety of approximate methods based on variational and amortized inference. Infomax learning for latent variable models thus offers a powerful approach for characterizing temporally structured latent states, with a wide variety of applications in neuroscience and beyond.},

Here, we asked whether such slow fluctuations arise as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited processing capacity or, alternatively, represent a structured mechanism of perceptual inference. Using 2 large-scale datasets, we found that humans and mice alternate between externally and internally oriented modes of sensory analysis. During external mode, perception aligns more closely with the external sensory information, whereas internal mode is characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history. Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are enabled by 2 interlinked factors: (i) the integration of subsequent inputs over time and (ii) slow antiphase oscillations in the impact of external sensory information versus internal predictions that are provided by perceptual history. We propose that between-mode fluctuations generate unambiguous error signals that enable optimal inference in volatile environments.},

	abstract = {In reversal learning tasks, the behavior of humans and animals is often assumed to be uniform within single experimental sessions to facilitate data analysis and model fitting. However, behavior of agents can display substantial variability in single experimental sessions, as they execute different blocks of trials with different transition dynamics. Here, we observed that in a deterministic reversal learning task, mice display noisy and sub-optimal choice transitions even at the expert stages of learning. We investigated two sources of the sub-optimality in the behavior. First, we found that mice exhibit a high lapse rate during task execution, as they reverted to unrewarded directions after choice transitions. Second, we unexpectedly found that a majority of mice did not execute a uniform strategy, but rather mixed between several behavioral modes with different transition dynamics. We quantified the use of such mixtures with a state-space model, block Hidden Markov Model (block HMM), to dissociate the mixtures of dynamic choice transitions in individual blocks of trials. Additionally, we found that blockHMM transition modes in rodent behavior can be accounted for by two different types of behavioral algorithms, model-free or inference-based learning, that might be used to solve the task. Combining these approaches, we found that mice used a mixture of both exploratory, model-free strategies and deterministic, inference-based behavior in the task, explaining their overall noisy choice sequences. Together, our combined computational approach highlights intrinsic sources of noise in rodent reversal learning behavior and provides a richer description of behavior than conventional techniques, while uncovering the hidden states that underlie the block-by-block transitions.},

	abstract = {People have a well-described advantage in identifying individuals and emotions in their own culture, a phenomenon also known as the other-race and language-familiarity effect. However, it is unclear whether native-language advantages arise from genuinely enhanced capacities to extract relevant cues in familiar speech or, more simply, from cultural differences in emotional expressions. Here, to rule out production differences, we use algorithmic voice transformations to create French and Japanese stimulus pairs that differed by exactly the same acoustical characteristics. In two cross-cultural experiments, participants performed better in their native language when categorizing vocal emotional cues and detecting non-emotional pitch changes. This advantage persisted over three types of stimulus degradation (jabberwocky, shuffled and reversed sentences), which disturbed semantics, syntax, and supra-segmental patterns, respectively. These results provide evidence that production differences are not the sole drivers of the language-familiarity effect in cross-cultural emotion perception. Listeners’ unfamiliarity with the phonology of another language, rather than with its syntax or semantics, impairs the detection of pitch prosodic cues and, in turn, the recognition of expressive prosody.},

Four methodologically related experiments illustrate the versatility of reverse correlation. Experiment 1 shows significant differences between the templates used by different observers when detecting a bright Gaussian blob. The results of Experiment 2 are consistent with observers not using information about the phase of a parafoveal wavelet when detecting it. Experiments 3 and 4 reveal not only the templates used by detection mechanisms but also aspects of their response functions. Both results are consistent with a sensory threshold. Experiment 3 shows that 2-alternative forced-choice detection errors are caused when the target’s effective contrast is reduced, not when the mask looks more like the expected target+mask than the actual target+mask. Experiment 4 suggests that observers use optimally tuned detection templates for orientation discrimination.},

Over the past decades, Ahumada (1996) developed a psychophysical reverse correlation technique, termed noise image classification (NIC), for deriving the linear properties of sensory filters in the context of audition first (Ahumada, 1967; Ahumada, Marken, \& Sandusky, 1975), and then vision (Ahumada, 1996, 2002; Beard \& Ahumada, 1998). This work explores ways of characterizing nonlinear aspects of psychophysical filters. One approach consists of an extension of the NIC technique (ExtNIC), whereby second-order (rather than just first-order) statistics in the classified noise are used to derive sensory kernels. It is shown that, under some conditions, this procedure yields a good estimate of second-order kernels. A second, different approach is also considered. This method uses functional minimization (fMin) to generate kernels that best simulate psychophysical responses for a given set of stimuli. Advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches are discussed. A mathematical appendix shows some interesting facts: (1) that nonlinearities affect the linear estimate (particularly target-present averages) obtained from the NIC method, providing a rationale for some related observations made by Ahumada (1967); (2) that for a linear filter followed by a static nonlinearity (LN system), the ExtNIC estimate of the second-order nonlinear kernel is correctly null, provided the criterion is unbiased; (3) that for a biased criterion, such an estimate may contain predictable modulations related to the linear filter; and (4) that under certain assumptions and conditions, ExtNIC does return a correct estimate for the second-order nonlinear kernel.},

	abstract = {Amblyopia results in a loss of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and position acuity. However, the nature of the neural losses is not yet fully understood. Here we report the results of experiments using noise to try to better understand the losses in amblyopia. Speciﬁcally, in one experiment we compared the performance of normal, amblyopic, and ideal observers for detecting a localized signal (a discrete frequency pattern or DFP) in ﬁxed contrast white noise. In a second experiment, we used visibility-scaled noise and varied both the visibility of the noise (from 2 to 20 times the noise detection threshold) and the spatial frequency of the signal. Our results show a loss of efﬁciency for detection of known signals in noise that increases with the spatial frequency of the signal in observers with amblyopia. To determine whether the loss of efﬁciency was a consequence of a mismatched template, we derived classiﬁcation images. We found that although the amblyopic observers’ template was shifted to lower spatial frequencies, the shift was insufﬁcient to account for their threshold elevation. Reduced efﬁciency in the amblyopic visual system may reﬂect a high level of internal noise, a poorly matched position template, or both. To analyze the type of internal noise we used an “N-pass” technique, in which observers performed the identical experiment N times (where N = 3 or 4). The amount of disagreement between the repeated trials enables us to parse the internal noise into random noise and consistent noise beyond that due to the poorly matched template. Our results show that the amblyopes’ reduced efﬁciency for detecting signals in noise is explained in part by reduced template efﬁciency but to a greater extent by increased random internal noise. This loss is more or less independent of external noise contrast over a log unit range of external noise.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Glioma is a common brain tumor. It can impair various cognitive functions such as social cognition. Prosody, a component of social cognition, remains little studied in glioma patients. Aim: The main aim of the study is to identify any impairment in the recognition of linguistic and/or emotional prosody in patients with glioma, before and after surgery. Materials and methods: 23 patients with glioma were evaluated preoperatively and 19 postoperatively. Different tasks were used to test recognition of linguistic and emotional prosody (i-MEL, Reverse Correlation, Pseudophrases).
Results: Deficits in prosody recognition are diagnosed as early as the preoperative assessment, with greater impairment of linguistic prosody than emotional prosody. After surgery, a decline in performance is revealed. Finally, only for linguistic prosody, the postoperative drop in performance is greater in patients with a right-hemisphere lesion. For all these results, inter-individual variability is noted. Discussion: These data are relatively innovative, as few studies have looked at prosody in glioma patients. Among studies of brain-injured patients, aprosodia is regularly found. More research is needed in this area to further explore the mechanisms underlying prosodic alterations.
Conclusion: This study highlights the clinical and fundamental importance of studying prosody in patients. Indeed, they appear to present prosody recognition disorders preoperatively, with a decline in performance postoperatively.},

            While judging their sensory environments, decision-makers seem to use the uncertainty about their choices to guide adjustments of their subsequent behaviour. One possible source of these behavioural adjustments is arousal: decision uncertainty might drive the brain’s arousal systems, which control global brain state and might thereby shape subsequent decision-making. Here, we measure pupil diameter, a proxy for central arousal state, in human observers performing a perceptual choice task of varying difficulty. Pupil dilation, after choice but before external feedback, reflects three hallmark signatures of decision uncertainty derived from a computational model. This increase in pupil-linked arousal boosts observers’ tendency to alternate their choice on the subsequent trial. We conclude that decision uncertainty drives rapid changes in pupil-linked arousal state, which shape the serial correlation structure of ongoing choice behaviour.},

We show that Volterra and Wiener series can be represented implicitly as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space by using polynomial kernels. The estimation complexity of the implicit representation is linear in the input dimensionality and independent of the degree of nonlinearity. Experiments show performance advantages in terms of convergence, interpretability, and system sizes that can be handled.},

	title = {Inferring learning rules from animal decision-making},
	abstract = {How do animals learn? This remains an elusive question in neuroscience. Whereas reinforcement learning often focuses on the design of algorithms that enable artiﬁcial agents to efﬁciently learn new tasks, here we develop a modeling framework to directly infer the empirical learning rules that animals use to acquire new behaviors. Our method efﬁciently infers the trial-to-trial changes in an animal’s policy, and decomposes those changes into a learning component and a noise component. Speciﬁcally, this allows us to: (i) compare different learning rules and objective functions that an animal may be using to update its policy; (ii) estimate distinct learning rates for different parameters of an animal’s policy; (iii) identify variations in learning across cohorts of animals; and (iv) uncover trial-to-trial changes that are not captured by normative learning rules. After validating our framework on simulated choice data, we applied our model to data from rats and mice learning perceptual decision-making tasks. We found that certain learning rules were far more capable of explaining trial-to-trial changes in an animal’s policy. Whereas the average contribution of the conventional REINFORCE learning rule to the policy update for mice learning the International Brain Laboratory’s task was just 30\%, we found that adding baseline parameters allowed the learning rule to explain 92\% of the animals’ policy updates under our model. Intriguingly, the best-ﬁtting learning rates and baseline values indicate that an animal’s policy update, at each trial, does not occur in the direction that maximizes expected reward. Understanding how an animal transitions from chance-level to high-accuracy performance when learning a new task not only provides neuroscientists with insight into their animals, but also provides concrete examples of biological learning algorithms to the machine learning community.},

These models provide reasonable characterizations between neural activity and motor behavior. However, they lack a description of movementrelated terms which are not observed directly in these experiments, such as muscular activation, the subject's level of attention, and other internal or external states. Here we propose to include a multi-dimensional hidden state to address these states in a GLM framework where the spike count at each time is described as a function of the hand state (position, velocity, and acceleration), truncated spike history, and the hidden state. The model can be identified by an ExpectationMaximization algorithm. We tested this new method in two datasets where spikes were simultaneously recorded using a multi-electrode array in the primary motor cortex of two monkeys. It was found that this method significantly improves the model-fitting over the classical GLM, for hidden dimensions varying from 1 to 4. This method also provides more accurate decoding of hand state (lowering the Mean Square Error by up to 29\% in some cases), while retaining real-time computational efficiency. These improvements on representation and decoding over the classical GLM model suggest that this new approach could contribute as a useful tool to motor cortical decoding and prosthetic applications.},

	title = {Efficient inference for time-varying behavior during learning},
	abstract = {The process of learning new behaviors over time is a problem of great interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, most standard analyses of animal training data either treat behavior as fixed or track only coarse performance statistics (e.g., accuracy, bias), providing limited insight into the evolution of the policies governing behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic psychophysical model that efficiently tracks trial-to-trial changes in behavior over the course of training. Our model consists of a dynamic logistic regression model, parametrized by a set of time-varying weights that express dependence on sensory stimuli as well as task-irrelevant covariates, such as stimulus, choice, and answer history. Our implementation scales to large behavioral datasets, allowing us to infer 500K parameters (e.g., 10 weights over 50K trials) in minutes on a desktop computer. We optimize hyperparameters governing how rapidly each weight evolves over time using the decoupled Laplace approximation, an efficient method for maximizing marginal likelihood in non-conjugate models. To illustrate performance, we apply our method to psychophysical data from both rats and human subjects learning a delayed sensory discrimination task. The model successfully tracks the psychophysical weights of rats over the course of training, capturing day-to-day and trial-to-trial fluctuations that underlie changes in performance, choice bias, and dependencies on task history. Finally, we investigate why rats frequently make mistakes on easy trials, and suggest that apparent lapses can be explained by sub-optimal weighting of known task covariates.},

	abstract = {Disease pathogenesis, a type of domain knowledge about biological mechanisms leading to diseases, has not been adequately encoded in machine-learning-based medical diagnostic models because of the inter-patient variabilities and complex dependencies of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. We propose 1) a novel pathogenesis probabilistic graphical model (PPGM) to quantify the dynamics underpinning patient-specific data and pathogenetic domain knowledge, 2) a Bayesian-based inference paradigm to answer the medical queries and forecast acute onsets. The PPGM model consists of two components: a Bayesian network of patient attributes and a temporal model of pathogenetic mechanisms. The model structure was reconstructed from expert knowledge elicitation, and its parameters were estimated using Variational Expectation­ Maximization algorithms. We benchmarked our model with two well-established hidden Markov models (HMMs) – Input-output HMM (IO-HMM) and Switching Auto-Regressive HMM (SAR­ HMM) – to evaluate the computational costs, forecasting performance, and execution time. Two case studies on Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) were used to validate the model. While the performance of the parameter learning step was equivalent to those of IO-HMM and SAR-HMM models, our model forecasting ability was outperforming those two models. The merits of the PPGM model are its representation capability to capture the dynamics of pathogenesis and perform medical inferences and its interpretability for physicians. The model has been used to perform medical queries and forecast the acute onset of OSA and PAF. Additional applications of the model include prognostic healthcare and preventive personalized treatments.},

Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on the cognitive requirements of a task. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that—even within a single task—the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the demands imposed by a task, as well as the internal state of mice when performing a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.},

Methods developed to uncover the currently employed DV revealed the use of multiple strategies and occasional switches in strategy within sessions. Optogenetic manipulations showed that the secondary motor cortex (M2) is needed for mice to use the different DVs in the task. Surprisingly, we found that regardless of which DV best explained the current behavior, M2 activity concurrently encoded a full basis set of computations defining a reservoir of DVs appropriate for alternative tasks.

To understand this increased variance, we trained separate linear encoding models on neural data from each state. The models demonstrated that although task variables and task-aligned movements impacted neural activity similarly during the two states, movements that are independent of task events explained more variance during disengagement. Behavioral analyses uncovered that during disengagement, movements become uncoupled to task events. Taken together, these results argue that the neural signature of disengagement, though obscured in trial-averaged neural activity, is evident in trial-to-trial variability driven by changing patterns of spontaneous movements.},

Several algorithms are able to search, score, and assign peptides to large MS/MS datasets. Most popular methods, however, underutilize the intensity information available in the tandem mass spectrum due to the complex nature of the peptide fragmentation process, thus contributing to loss of potential identiﬁcations. We present a novel probabilistic scoring algorithm called Context-Sensitive Peptide Identiﬁcation (CSPI) based on highly ﬂexible Input-Output Hidden Markov Models (IO-HMM) that capture the inﬂuence of peptide physicochemical properties on their observed MS/MS spectra. We use several local and global properties of peptides and their fragment ions from literature. Comparison with two popular algorithms, Crux (re-implementation of SEQUEST) and X!Tandem, on multiple datasets of varying complexity, shows that peptide identiﬁcation scores from our models are able to achieve greater discrimination between true and false peptides, identifying up to *25\% more peptides at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 1\%. We evaluated two alternative normalization schemes for fragment ion-intensities, a global rank-based and a local window-based. Our results indicate the importance of appropriate normalization methods for learning superior models. Further, combining our scores with Crux using a state-of-the-art procedure, Percolator, we demonstrate the utility of using scoring features from intensity-based models, identifying *4-8 \% additional identiﬁcations over Percolator at 1\% FDR. IO-HMMs offer a scalable and ﬂexible framework with several modeling choices to learn complex patterns embedded in MS/MS data.},

	abstract = {A central goal in neuroscience is to identify the strategies used by animals and humans as they make decisions, and to characterize the learning rules that shape these policies in the first place. In this thesis, I discuss three projects aimed at tackling this goal. In the first, we introduce a novel framework, the GLM-HMM, for characterizing mouse and human choice policies during binary decision-making tasks. The GLM-HMM is a hidden Markov model with Bernoulli Generalized Linear Model observations. By fitting the GLM-HMM to hundreds of thousands of decisions, our framework revealed that — contrary to common wisdom — mice and humans use multiple strategies over the course of a single session to perform perceptual decision-making tasks. In the second project, we sought to uncover the learning rules used by mice and rats as they learned to perform this type of task. Our model tracked trial-to-trial changes in the animals’ choice policies, and separated these changes into components explainable by a reinforcement learning rule, and components that remained unexplained. Whereas the average contribution of the conventional REINFORCE learning rule to the policy update for mice learning a common task was just 30\%, we found that adding baseline parameters allowed the learning rule to explain 92\% of the animals’ policy updates under our model. Finally, I discuss our approach to applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to the trajectories of mice exploring a maze environment. While IRL has been widely applied in robotics and healthcare settings to infer the unknown reward function of an agent, it has yet to be applied extensively in neuroscience. One potential reason for this is that existing IRL frameworks assume that an agent’s reward function is fixed over time. To overcome this limitation, we introduce ‘DIRL’, an IRL framework that allows for time-varying intrinsic rewards. Our method returns interpretable reward functions for two separate cohorts of mice, and provides a novel characterization of exploratory behavior. Overall, we anticipate ‘DIRL’ having broad applicability in neuroscience, and that it could also facilitate the design of biologically-inspired reward functions for training artificial agents to perform analogous tasks.},

	abstract = {Hallucinations are vivid and transient experiences of objects, such as images or sounds, that occur in the absence of a corresponding stimulus.1–9 To understand the neurocomputational mechanisms of hallucinations, cognitive neuroscience has focused on experiments that induce false alarms (FAs) in healthy participants,1–5,9 psychosis-prone individuals,1,3,4 and patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.5 FAs occur when participants make decisions about difﬁcult-to-detect stimuli and indicate the presence of a signal that was, in fact, not presented. Since FAs are, at heart, reports, they must meet two criteria to serve as an experimental proxy for hallucinations: ﬁrst, FAs should reﬂect perceptual states that are characterized by speciﬁc contents10–12 (criterion 1). Second, FAs should occur on a timescale compatible with the temporal dynamics of hallucinations13,14 (criterion 2). In this work, we combined a classiﬁcation image approach15 with hidden Markov models16 to show that FAs can match the perceptual and temporal characteristics of hallucinations. We asked healthy human participants to discriminate visual stimuli from noise and found that FAs were more likely to occur during an internal mode of sensory processing, a minute-long state of the brain during which perception is strongly biased toward previous experiences17 (serial dependency). Our results suggest that hallucinations are driven by dynamic predictive templates that transform noise into transient, coherent, and meaningful perceptual experiences.},

Specifically, prosodic characteristics related to speech rate, duration, pitch, and intensity were examined in three types of interrogative sentences (wh-questions, yes-no questions, alternative questions) with auditory perceptual evaluation. As a result, the statistically significant key variables showed flaws in production of the linguistic prosody in the speakers with LHD. The statistically significant variables were more insufficiently produced for wh-questions than for yes-no and alternative questions. This trend was particularly noticeable in variables related to pitch and speech rate. This result suggests that when Korean speakers process linguistic prosody, such as that of lexico-semantic and syntactic information in interrogative sentences, the left hemisphere seems to be superior to the right hemisphere.},

	abstract = {During acoustic communication in humans, information about a speaker’s emotional state is predominantly conveyed by modulation of the tone of voice (emotional or affective prosody). Based on lesion data, a right hemisphere superiority for cerebral processing of emotional prosody has been assumed. However, the available clinical studies do not yet provide a coherent picture with respect to interhemispheric lateralization effects of prosody recognition and intrahemispheric localization of the respective brain regions. To further delineate the cerebral network engaged in the perception of emotional tone, a series of experiments was carried out based upon functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The ﬁndings obtained from these investigations allow for the separation of three successive processing stages during recognition of emotional prosody: (1) extraction of suprasegmental acoustic information predominantly subserved by right-sided primary and higher order acoustic regions; (2) representation of meaningful suprasegmental acoustic sequences within posterior aspects of the right superior temporal sulcus; (3) explicit evaluation of emotional prosody at the level of the bilateral inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, implicit processing of affective intonation seems to be bound to subcortical regions mediating automatic induction of speciﬁc emotional reactions such as activation of the amygdala in response to fearful stimuli. As concerns lower level processing of the underlying suprasegmental acoustic cues, linguistic and emotional prosody seem to share the same right hemisphere neural resources. Explicit judgment of linguistic aspects of speech prosody, however, appears to be linked to left-sided language areas whereas bilateral orbitofrontal cortex has been found involved in explicit evaluation of emotional prosody. These differences in hemispheric lateralization effects might explain that speciﬁc impairments in nonverbal emotional communication subsequent to focal brain lesions are relatively rare clinical observations as compared to the more frequent aphasic disorders.},

	abstract = {Exposure to auditory white noise has been shown to facilitate cognitive function. This phenomenon is often called stochastic resonance, and a moderate amount of auditory noise has been suggested to benefit individuals in hypodopaminergic states. Previous studies using psychophysic methods reported that stochastic resonance was sensitive to stimulus intensity; however, the relationship between neural activities elicited by different stimulus intensities and auditory white noise has not yet been clarified Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of stimulus intensity (Experiment 1) and auditory white noise (Experiment 2) on behavioral data (reaction time (RT), the standard deviation of RT, and error rates), and the N140 and P300 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) in somatosensory Go/No-go paradigms. The subjects had to respond to the somatosensory stimuli by pressing a button with their right thumb only after presentation of the Go stimulus. In Experiment 1 with four different stimulus intensity levels, the peak latencies of N140 and P300 became shorter, and the peak amplitudes of N140 and P300 were enhanced with increases in stimulus intensity. In Experiment 2 with weak and mild intensities under auditory white noise and control conditions, the amplitudes of Go-P300 and No-go-P300 were enhanced by white noise, irrespective of weak and mild intensities, during Go/No-go paradigms. Auditory white noise did not significantly affect the amplitude of N140 or the latencies of N140 and P300. These results suggest the presence of a characteristic cross-modal stochastic resonance in neural substrates utilizing somatosensory ERPs.},

It is unclear, however, how to statistically quantify the amount of signal present in CIs, which limits the interpretability of these images. In this article, we propose a novel metric, infoVal, which assesses informational value relative to a resampled random distribution and can be interpreted like a z score. In the first part, we define the infoVal metric and show, through simulations, that it adheres to typical Type I error rates under various task conditions (internal validity). In the second part, we show that the metric correlates with markers of data quality in empirical reverse-correlation data, such as the subjective recognizability, objective discriminability, and test–retest reliability of the CIs (convergent validity). In the final part, we demonstrate how the infoVal metric can be used to compare the informational value of reverse-correlation datasets, by comparing data acquired online with data acquired in a controlled lab environment. We recommend a new standard of good practice in which researchers assess the infoVal scores of reverse-correlation data in order to ensure that they do not read signal in CIs where no signal is present. The infoVal metric is implemented in the open-source rcicr R package, to facilitate its adoption.},

Determining how many strategies are used by a participant as well as their identification at a trial level is a challenging problem for researchers. In the current paper, we propose a new method – the non-parametric mixture model – to efficiently disentangle hidden strategies in cognitive psychological data, based on observed response times. The developed method derived from standard hidden Markov modeling. Importantly, we used a model-free approach where a particular shape of a response time distribution does not need to be assumed. This has the considerable advantage of avoiding potentially unreliable results when an inappropriate response time distribution is assumed. Through three simulation studies and two applications to real data, we repeatedly demonstrated that the nonparametric mixture model is able to reliably recover hidden strategies present in the data as well as to accurately estimate the number of concurrent strategies. The results also showed that this new method is more efficient than a standard parametric approach. The non-parametric mixture model is therefore a useful statistical tool for strategy identification that can be applied in many areas of cognitive psychology. To this end, practical guidelines are provided for researchers wishing to apply the non-parametric mixture models on their own data set.},

            Neural representation is often described by the tuning curves of individual neurons with respect to certain stimulus variables. Despite this tradition, it has become increasingly clear that neural tuning can vary substantially in accordance with a collection of internal and external factors. A challenge we are facing is the lack of appropriate methods to accurately capture the moment-to-moment tuning variability directly from the noisy neural responses. Here we introduce an unsupervised statistical approach, Poisson functional principal component analysis (Pf-PCA), which identifies different sources of systematic tuning fluctuations, moreover encompassing several current models (e.g.,multiplicative gain models) as special cases. Applying this method to neural data recorded from macaque primary visual cortex– a paradigmatic case for which the tuning curve approach has been scientifically essential– we discovered a simple relationship governing the variability of orientation tuning, which unifies different types of gain changes proposed previously. By decomposing the neural tuning variability into interpretable components, our method enables discovery of unexpected structure of the neural code, capturing the influence of the external stimulus drive and internal states simultaneously.},

            According to Bayesian models, both decisions and confidence are based on the same precision-weighted integration of prior expectations (“priors”) and incoming information (“likelihoods”). This assumes that priors are integrated optimally and equally in decisions and confidence, which has not been tested. In three experiments, we quantify how priors inform decisions and confidence. With a dual-decision task we create pairs of conditions that are matched in posterior information, but differ on whether the prior or likelihood is more informative. We find that priors are underweighted in discrimination decisions, but are less underweighted in confidence about those decisions, and this is not due to differences in processing time. The same patterns remain with exogenous probabilistic cues as priors. With a Bayesian model we quantify the weighting parameters for the prior at both levels, and find converging evidence that priors are more optimally used in explicit confidence, even when underused in decisions.},

            We used a dynamical systems perspective to understand decision-related neural activity, a fundamentally unresolved problem. This perspective posits that time-varying neural activity is described by a state equation with an initial condition and evolves in time by combining at each time step, recurrent activity and inputs. We hypothesized various dynamical mechanisms of decisions, simulated them in models to derive predictions, and evaluated these predictions by examining firing rates of neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of monkeys performing a perceptual decision-making task. Prestimulus neural activity (i.e., the initial condition) predicted poststimulus neural trajectories, covaried with RT and the outcome of the previous trial, but not with choice. Poststimulus dynamics depended on both the sensory evidence and initial condition, with easier stimuli and fast initial conditions leading to the fastest choice-related dynamics. Together, these results suggest that initial conditions combine with sensory evidence to induce decision-related dynamics in PMd.},

            Humans’ ability to adapt and learn relies on reflecting on past performance. These experiences form latent representations called internal states that induce movement variability that improves how we interact with our environment. Our study uncovered temporal dynamics and neural substrates of two states from ten subjects implanted with intracranial depth electrodes while they performed a goal-directed motor task with physical perturbations. We identified two internal states using state-space models: one tracking past errors and the other past perturbations. These states influenced reaction times and speed errors, revealing how subjects strategize from trial history. Using local field potentials from over 100 brain regions, we found large-scale brain networks such as the dorsal attention and default mode network modulate visuospatial attention based on recent performance and environmental feedback. Notably, these networks were more prominent in higher-performing subjects, emphasizing their role in improving motor performance by regulating movement variability through internal states.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Trial history biases and lapses are two of the most common suboptimalities observed during perceptual decision-making. These suboptimalities are routinely assumed to arise from distinct processes. However, previous work has suggested that they covary in their prevalence and that their proposed neural substrates overlap. Here we demonstrate that during decision-making, history biases and apparent lapses can both arise from a common cognitive process that is optimal under mistaken beliefs that the world is changing i.e. nonstationary. This corresponds to an accumulation-to-bound model with history-dependent updates to the initial state of the accumulator. We test our model’s predictions about the relative prevalence of history biases and lapses, and show that they are robustly borne out in two distinct decision-making datasets of male rats, including data from a novel reaction time task. Our model improves the ability to precisely predict decision-making dynamics within and across trials, by positing a process through which agents can generate quasi-stochastic choices.},

This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist.

	abstract = {The operation of a variety of natural or man-made systems subject to uncertainty is maintained within a range of safe behavior through run-time sensing of the system state and control actions selected according to some strategy. When the system is observed from an external perspective, the control strategy may not be known and it should rather be reconstructed by joint observation of the applied control actions and the corresponding evolution of the system state. This is largely hurdled by limitations in the sensing of the system state and different levels of noise. We address the problem of optimal selection of control actions for a stochastic system with unknown dynamics operating under a controller with unknown strategy, for which we can observe trajectories made of the sequence of control actions and noisy observations of the system state which are labeled by the exact value of some reward functions. To this end, we present an approach to train an Input–Output Hidden Markov Model (IO-HMM) as the generative stochastic model that describes the state dynamics of a POMDP by the application of a novel optimization objective adopted from the literate. The learning task is hurdled by two restrictions: the only available sensed data are the limited number of trajectories of applied actions, noisy observations of the system state, and system state; and, the high failure costs prevent interaction with the online environment, preventing exploratory testing. Traditionally, stochastic generative models have been used to learn the underlying system dynamics and select appropriate actions in the deﬁned task. However, current state of the art techniques, in which the state dynamics of the POMDP is ﬁrst learned and then strategies are optimized over it, frequently fail because the model that best ﬁts the data may not be well suited for controlling. By using the aforementioned optimization objective, we try to to tackle the problems related to model mis-speciﬁcation. The proposed methodology is illustrated in a scenario of failure avoidance for a multi component system. The quality of the decision making is evaluated by using the collected reward on the test data and compared against the previous literature usual approach.},

	abstract = {Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which the performance of certain non-linear detectors can be enhanced by the addition of appropriate levels of random noise. Signal detection theory oﬀers a powerful tool for analysing this type of system, through an ability to separate detection processes into reception and classiﬁcation, with the former generally being linear and the latter always non-linear. Through appropriate measures of signal detectability it is possible to decide whether a local improvement in detection via stochastic resonance occurs due to the non-linear eﬀects of the classiﬁcation process. In this case, improvement of detection through the addition of noise can never improve detection beyond that of a corresponding adaptive system. Signal detection and stochastic resonance is investigated in several integrate-and-ﬁre neuron models. It is demonstrated that the stochastic resonance observed in spiking models is caused by non-linear properties of the spike-generation process itself. The true detectability of the signal, as seen by the receiver part of the spiking neuron (the integrator part), decreases monotonically with input noise level for all signal and noise intensities.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Hemispheric specialization for the comprehension and expression of linguistic and emotional prosody is typically attributed to the right hemisphere. This study used techniques adapted from meta-analysis to critically examine the strength of existing evidence for hemispheric lateralization of prosody following brain damage.
Method: Twenty-one databases were searched for articles published from 1970 to 2020 addressing differences in prosody performance between groups defined by right hemisphere damage and left hemisphere damage. Hedges’s g effect sizes were calculated for all possible prosody comparisons. Primary analyses summarize effects for four types: linguistic production, linguistic comprehension, emotion comprehension, and emotion production. Within each primary analysis, Hedges’s g values were averaged across comparisons (usually from a single article) based on the same sample of individuals. Secondary analyses explore more specific classifications of comparisons.
Results: Out of the 113 articles investigating comprehension and production of emotional and linguistic prosody, 62 were deemed appropriate for data extraction, but only 21 met inclusion criteria, passed quality reviews, and provided sufficient information for analysis. Evidence from this review illustrates the heterogeneity of research methods and results from studies that have investigated aprosodia. This review provides inconsistent support for selective contribution of the two cerebral hemispheres to prosody comprehension and production; however, the strongest finding suggests that right hemisphere lesions disrupt emotional prosody comprehension more than left hemisphere lesions.
Conclusion: This review highlights the impoverished nature of the existing literature; offers suggestions for future research; and highlights relevant clinical implications for the prognostication, evaluation, and treatment of aprosodia.},

Individuals with high-frequency loss relied slightly less heavily on the high-frequency cue relative to the low-frequency cue, compared with NH individuals, suggesting a possible influence of supra-threshold deficits on cue-weighting strategies.

Although all listeners relied more heavily on the high-frequency cue than on the low-frequency cue, an important variability was observed in the individual weights, mostly explained by differences in internal noise. Individuals with high-frequency loss relied slightly less heavily on the high-frequency cue relative to the low-frequency cue, compared with NH individuals, suggesting a possible influence of supra-threshold deficits on cue-weighting strategies. Altogether, these results suggest a need for individually tailored speech-in-noise processing in hearing aids, if more effective speech discriminability in noise is to be achieved.},

	abstract = {With the introduction of the psychophysical method of reverse correlation, a holy grail of social psychology appears to be within reach – visualising mental representations. Reverse correlation is a data-driven method that yields visual proxies of mental representations, based on judgements of randomly varying stimuli. This review is a primer to an inﬂuential reverse correlation approach in which stimuli vary by applying random noise to the pixels of images. Our review suggests that the technique is an invaluable tool in the investigation of social perception (e.g., in the perception of race, gender and personality traits), with ample potential applications. However, it is unclear how these visual proxies are best interpreted. Building on advances in cognitive neuroscience, we suggest that these proxies are visual reﬂections of the internal representations that determine how social stimuli are perceived. In addition, we provide a tutorial on how to perform reverse correlation experiments using R.},

	abstract = {A recent analysis of the energy detector model in sensory psychophysics concluded that stochastic resonance does not occur in a measure of signal detectability (d¢), but can occur in a percent-correct measure of performance as an epiphenomenon of nonoptimal criterion placement [Tougaard (2000) Biol Cybern 83: 471–480]. When generalized to signal detection in sensory systems in general, this conclusion is a serious challenge to the idea that stochastic resonance could play a signiﬁcant role in sensory processing in humans and other animals. It also seems to be inconsistent with recent demonstrations of stochastic resonance in sensory systems of both nonhuman animals and humans using measures of system performance such as signal-to-noise ratio of power spectral densities and percent-correct detections in a two-interval forcedchoice paradigm, both closely related to d¢. In this paper we address this apparent dilemma by discussing several models of how stochastic resonance can arise in signal detection systems, including especially those that implement a ‘‘soft threshold’’ at the input transform stage. One example involves redeﬁning d¢ for energy increments in terms of parameters of the spike-count distribution of FitzHugh–Nagumo neurons. Another involves a Poisson spike generator that receives an exponentially transformed noisy periodic signal. In this case it can be shown that the signal-to-noise ratio of the power spectral density at the signal frequency, which exhibits stochastic resonance, is proportional to d¢. Finally, a variant of d¢ is shown to exhibit stochastic resonance when calculated directly from the distributions of power spectral densities at the signal frequency resulting from transformation of noise alone and a noisy signal by a suﬃciently steep nonlinear response function. All of these examples, and others from the literature, imply that stochastic resonance is more than an epiphenomenon, although signiﬁcant limitations to the extent to which adding noise can aid detection do exist.},

	abstract = {Human visual performance for basic visual dimensions (e.g., contrast sensitivity and acuity) peaks at the fovea and decreases with eccentricity. The eccentricity effect is related to the larger visual cortical surface area corresponding to the fovea, but it is unknown if differential feature tuning contributes to this eccentricity effect. Here, we investigated two system-level computations underlying the eccentricity effect: featural representation (tuning) and internal noise. Observers (both sexes) detected a Gabor embedded in filtered white noise which appeared at the fovea or one of four perifoveal locations. We used psychophysical reverse correlation to estimate the weights assigned by the visual system to a range of orientations and spatial frequencies (SFs) in noisy stimuli, which are conventionally interpreted as perceptual sensitivity to the corresponding features. We found higher sensitivity to task-relevant orientations and SFs at the fovea than that at the perifovea, and no difference in selectivity for either orientation or SF. Concurrently, we measured response consistency using a double-pass method, which allowed us to infer the level of internal noise by implementing a noisy observer model. We found lower internal noise at the fovea than that at the perifovea. Finally, individual variability in contrast sensitivity correlated with sensitivity to and selectivity for task-relevant features as well as with internal noise. Moreover, the behavioral eccentricity effect mainly reflects the foveal advantage in orientation sensitivity compared with other computations. These findings suggest that the eccentricity effect stems from a better representation of task-relevant features and lower internal noise at the fovea than that at the perifovea.},

Our review reveals a need to develop theoretically motivated and methodologically integrated approaches to the study of context-driven comprehension and expression of pragmatic-affective prosody, which will help elucidate the core features of socio-communicative problems in individuals with mental disorders. We propose that comprehensive models within and across the conventional cognition-emotion-language trichotomy need to be developed to integrate current findings and guide future research. In particular, there needs to be due emphasis on investigating multisensory and cross-modal effects in normal and pathological prosody research.

            Speakers of all human languages regularly use intonational pitch to convey linguistic meaning, such as to emphasize a particular word. Listeners extract pitch movements from speech and evaluate the shape of intonation contours independent of each speaker’s pitch range. We used high-density electrocorticography to record neural population activity directly from the brain surface while participants listened to sentences that varied in intonational pitch contour, phonetic content, and speaker. Cortical activity at single electrodes over the human superior temporal gyrus selectively represented intonation contours. These electrodes were intermixed with, yet functionally distinct from, sites that encoded different information about phonetic features or speaker identity. Furthermore, the representation of intonation contours directly reflected the encoding of speaker-normalized relative pitch but not absolute pitch.},

In this study, directed attention and sustained attention, which are thought to be crucial for driving, were examined. Identification of specific brain structure abnormalities associated with post-stroke cognitive dysfunction related to driving ability would help in determining fitness for car driving after stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 57 post-stroke patients (51 men; mean age, 63 ± 11 years) who were assessed for attention deficit using a standardized test (the Clinical Assessment for Attention, CAT), which includes a Continuous Performance Test (CPT)-simple version (CPT-SRT), the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT), and a driving simulator (handle task for dividing attention, and simple and selective reaction times for sustained attention). A statistical non-parametric map (SnPM) that displayed the association between lesion location and cognitive function for car driving was created. From the SnPM analysis, the overlay plots were localized to the right hemisphere during handling the hit task for bilateral sides (left hemisphere damage related to right-side neglect and right hemisphere damage related to left-side neglect) and during simple and selective reaction times (false recognition was related to damage of both hemispheres). A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the importance of both hemispheres, especially the right hemisphere, for cognitive function and car driving ability. The present study demonstrated that the right hemisphere has a crucial role for maintaining directed attention and sustained attention, which maintain car driving ability, improving QOL for stroke survivors.},

Language-related functions of the DLPFC comprise various aspects of pragmatic processing such as discourse management, integration of prosody, interpretation of nonliteral meanings, inference making, ambiguity resolution, and error repair. Neurophysiologically, the DLPFC seems to be a key region for implementing functional connectivity between the language network and other functional networks, including cortico-cortical as well as subcortical circuits. Considering clinical aspects, damage to the DLPFC causes psychiatric communication deﬁcits rather than typical aphasic language syndromes. Although the number of well-controlled studies on DLPFC language functions is still limited, the DLPFC might be an important target region for the treatment of pragmatic language disorders.},

	abstract = {Cerebral achromatopsia is an acquired colour perception impairment caused by brain injury, and is generally considered to be rare. Both hemispheres are thought to contribute to colour perception, but most published cases have had bilateral or right hemisphere lesions. In contrast to congenital colour blindness that affects the discrimination between specific hues, cerebral achromatopsia is often described as affecting perception across all colours. Most studies of cerebral achromatopsia have been single cases or case series of patients with colour perception deficits. Here, we explore colour perception deficits in an unbiased sample of patients with stroke affecting the posterior cerebral artery (N = 63) from the Back of the Brain project. Patients were selected based on lesion location only, and not on the presence of a given symptom. All patients were tested with the Farnsworth D-15 Dichotomous Colour Blindness Test and performance compared to matched controls (N = 45) using single case statistics. In patients with abnormal performance, the patterns of colour difficulties were qualitatively analysed. 22\% of the patients showed significant problems with colour discrimination (44\% of patients with bilateral lesions, 28\% with left hemisphere lesions and 5\% with right hemisphere lesions). Lesion analyses identified two regions in ventral occipital temporal areas in the left hemisphere as particularly strongly related to impaired performance in colour perception, but also indicated that bilateral lesions are more strongly associated with impaired performance that unilateral lesions. While some patients only had mild deficits, colour perception impairments were in many cases severe. Many patients had selective deficits only affecting the perception of some hues. The results suggest that colour perception difficulties following PCA stroke are common, and that they vary in severity and expression. In addition, the results point towards bilateral processing of colour perception with a left hemispheric domination, contradicting previous reports.},

	abstract = {Alexia refers to a reading disorder caused by some form of acquired brain pathology, most commonly a stroke or tumor, in a previously literate subject. In neuropsychology, a distinction is made between central alexia (commonly seen in aphasia) and peripheral alexia (a perceptual or attentional deficit). The prototypical peripheral alexia is alexia without agraphia (pure alexia), where patients can write but are impaired in reading words and letters. Pure alexia is associated with damage to the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) or its connections. Hemianopic alexia is associated with less extensive occipital damage and is caused by a visual field defect, which creates problems reading longer words and passages of text. Reading impairment can also arise due to attentional deficits, most commonly following right hemisphere or bilateral lesions. Studying patients with alexia, along with functional imaging studies of normal readers, has improved our understanding of the neurobiological processes involved in reading. A key question is whether an area in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex is specialized for or selectively involved in word processing, or whether reading relies on tuning of more general purpose perceptual areas. Reading deficits may also be observed in dementia and traumatic brain injury, but often with less consistent deficit patterns than in patients with focal lesions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Facial emotion perception and recognition (FEPR) deficits are the sources of disability, impaired social relationship, and reduced quality of life. Studies of unilateral acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remain controversial about FEPR deficits.
METHODS: Clinical and neurocognitive data were collected and analyzed among normal controls (NC) and AIS patients with left brain damage (LBD), right brain damage (RBD), and infratentorial brain damage (IBD). To assess FEPR, all participants completed a localization test (the Southeastern China Brief Affect Recognition Test). Correlation analyses were conducted between the FEPR deficits and cognitive functions.
RESULTS: Compared with NC, all three groups of AIS patients reported significant FEPR deficits. Although no statistical difference in FEPR deficits were observed among the LBD, RBD and IBD patients, the deficit patterns were markedly different. FEPR deficits were positively correlated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: FEPR deficits may occur in AIS patients and are associated with impaired cognitive functions, where the cerebral hemispheres and the infratentorial brain are jointly involved. Early recognition and early intervention of FEPR deficits in AIS patients are critical for post-stroke rehabilitation, reconstruction of social function and improvement in life quality.},

	abstract = {Neuropsychology includes both the psychiatric manifestations of neurological illness (primary brain-based disorders) and neurobiology of "idiopathic" psychiatric disorders. Neurological primary brain disorders provoke broad spectrum of brain pathophysiology that cause deficit sin human behaviour, and the magnitude of neurobehavioral-related problems is a world wide health concern. Speech disorders of aphasic type, unilateral neglect, anosognosia (deficit disorders), delirium and mood disorders (productive disorders) in urgent neurology, first of all in acute phase of stroke are more frequent disorders then it verified in routine exam, not only in the developed and large neurological departments. Aphasia is common consequence of left hemispheric lesion and most common neuropsychological consequence of stroke, with prevalence of one third of all stroke patients in acute phase although exist reports on greater frequency. Unilateral neglect is a disorder that mostly effects the patient after the lesion of the right hemisphere, mostly caused by a cerebrovascular insult (infarct or haemorrhage affecting a large area - up to two thirds of the right hemisphere), and in general the left-side neglect is the most widespread neuropsychological deficit after the lesion of the right cerebral hemisphere. Reports on the incidence of visual neglect vary and they range from 13 to 85\%. Anosognosia is on the second place as neuropsychological syndrome of stroke in right hemisphere, characterized by the denial of the motor, visual or cognitive deficit. This syndrome, defined as denial of hemiparesis or hemianopsia, is a common disorder verified in 17-28\% of all patents with acute brain stoke. There are different reports on frequency of delirium in acute stroke, from 24 to 48\%, and it is more frequent in hemorrhagic then ischemic stoke. Post stroke depression (PSD) is one of the more frequent consequences on the stroke, and the prevalence of PSD has ranged from 5 to 63\% of patients in several cross-sectional studies, peaking three to six months after a stroke.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: State-of-the-art stroke treatment significantly reduces lesion size and stroke severity, but it remains unclear whether these therapeutic advances have diminished the burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).
AIMS: In a cohort of patients receiving modern state-of-the-art stroke care including endovascular therapy, we assessed the frequency of PSCI and the pattern of domain-specific cognitive deficits, identified risk factors for PSCI, and determined the impact of acute PSCI on stroke outcome.
METHODS: In this prospective monocentric cohort study, we examined patients with first-ever anterior circulation ischemic stroke without pre-stroke cognitive decline, using a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment ⩽10 days after symptom onset. Normative data were stratified by demographic variables. We defined PSCI as at least moderate ({\textless}1.5 standard deviation) deficits in ⩾2 cognitive domains. Multivariable regression analysis was applied to define risk factors for PSCI.
RESULTS: We analyzed 329 non-aphasic patients admitted from December 2020 to July 2023 (67.2 ± 14.4 years old, 41.3\% female, 13.1 ± 2.7 years of education). Although most patients had mild stroke (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 24 h = 1.00 (0.00; 3.00); 87.5\% with NIHSS ⩽ 5), 69.3\% of them presented with PSCI 2.7 ± 2.0 days post-stroke. The most severely and often affected cognitive domains were verbal learning, episodic memory, executive functions, selective attention, and constructive abilities (39.1\%-51.2\% of patients), whereas spatial neglect was less frequent (18.5\%). The risk of PSCI was reduced with more years of education (odds ratio (OR) = 0.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.99) and right hemisphere lesions (OR = 0.47, 95\% CI = 0.26-0.84), and increased with stroke severity (NIHSS 24 h, OR = 4.19, 95\% CI = 2.72-6.45), presence of hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.93, 95\% CI = 1.01-3.68), but was not influenced by age. After adjusting for stroke severity and depressive symptoms, acute PSCI was associated with poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale {\textgreater} 2, F = 13.695, p {\textless} 0.001) and worse global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, F = 20.069, p {\textless} 0.001) at 3 months post-stroke.
CONCLUSION: Despite modern stroke therapy and many strokes having mild severity, PSCI in the acute stroke phase remains frequent and associated with worse outcome. The most prevalent were learning and memory deficits. Cognitive reserve operationalized as years of education independently protects post-stroke cognition.},

	abstract = {Theories of lateralized cognitive functions propose a dominance of the left hemisphere for motor control and of the right hemisphere for spatial attention. Accordingly, spatial attention deficits (e.g., neglect) are more frequently observed after right-hemispheric stroke, whereas apraxia is a common consequence of left-hemispheric stroke. Clinical reports of spatial attentional deficits after left hemisphere (LH) stroke also exist, but are often neglected. By applying parallel analysis (PA) and voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) to data from a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of 74 LH stroke patients, we here systematically investigate the relationship between spatial inattention and apraxia and their neural bases. PA revealed that apraxic (and language comprehension) deficits loaded on one common component, while deficits in attention tests were explained by another independent component. Statistical lesion analyses with the individual component scores showed that apraxic (and language comprehension) deficits were significantly associated with lesions of the left superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF). Data suggest that in LH stroke spatial attention deficits dissociate from apraxic (and language comprehension) deficits. These findings contribute to models of lateralised cognitive functions in the human brain. Moreover, our findings strongly suggest that LH stroke patients should be assessed systematically for spatial attention deficits so that these can be included in their rehabilitation regime.},

The aim of the study was to perform a comprehensive assessment of selective and intensive attention processes in a large population of brain-damaged patients, evaluating the influence of the side and site of the brain lesion, the time from stroke, and the concomitant presence of aphasia or neglect. We assessed 204 patients with a first unilateral brain lesion and 42 healthy individuals with three subtests of the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP): Alertness, Go-No Go, and Divided Attention. 44.4\% of patients had an impairment in both intensive and selective aspects of attention, 5.6\% had deficits only in the intensive component, and 31.8\% had deficits only in selective tasks. More than 80\% of the patients fell below the cut-off point on at least one task. Patients with a right hemispheric lesion (RHL) were more impaired than patients with a left hemispheric lesion (LHL) especially in tonic and phasic alertness. Patients with total anterior infarcts (TACI) presented the worst profile compared to other stroke subtypes, with a difference between total and lacunar subtypes in the Alertness test, independent of the presence of warning. Patients in the chronic phase had shorter RTs than acute patients only in the Alertness test. In patients with LHL, the presence of aphasia was associated with a greater deficit in selective attention. In patients with RHL, the presence of unilateral neglect was associated with impaired alertness and selective attention. Attention deficits are common after a unilateral first stroke. In keeping with the hierarchical organization of attention functions, results confirm the important role of the right hemisphere for the intensive components of attention, also highlighting the involvement of left hemisphere functioning for the selective aspects, possibly indicating a role of its linguistic functions.},

	abstract = {Background
              Depression is the most frequent psychiatric condition after stroke and is associated with negative health outcomes. We aim to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke.
            
            
              Methods and findings
              Studies published up to 4 November 2022 on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. We included studies of adults with stroke, where depression was assessed at a prespecified time point. Studies excluding people with aphasia and history of depression are excluded. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) cohort study tool was used to assess risk of bias. A total of 77 studies were included in the pooled estimates of the prevalence of poststroke depression (PSD). The overall prevalence of depression was 27\% (95\% CI 25 to 30). Prevalence of depression was 24\% (95\% CI 21 to 28) by clinical interview and 29\% (95\% CI 25 to 32) by rating scales. Twenty-four studies with more than one assessment time point reported the natural history of PSD. Among people who were depressed within 3 months of stroke, 53\% (95\% CI 47 to 59) experienced persistent depression, while 44\% (95\% CI 38 to 50) recovered. The incidence of later depression (3 to 12 months after stroke) was 9\% (95\% CI 7 to 12). The cumulative incidence during 1 year after stroke was 38\% (95\% CI 33 to 43), and the majority (71\% (95\% CI 65 to 76)) of depression had onset within 3 months after stroke. The main limitation of the present study is that excluding people in source studies with severe impairments may produce imprecise estimates of the prevalence of PSD.
            
            
              Conclusions
              In this study, we observed that stroke survivors with early-onset depression (within 3 months after stroke) are at high risks for remaining depressed and make up two-thirds of the incident cases during 1 year after stroke. This highlights the need for ongoing clinical monitoring of patients depressed shortly after stroke.

	abstract = {Neglect patients' performance during cancellation tasks is characterized by left sided omissions and, in many cases, by the production of inappropriate material of various kinds in the ipsilesional space, e.g. additional marks over already cancelled targets, marks drawn away from targets, scribbles, irrelevant drawings. It is unclear whether these behaviours, which have collectively been called perseverative, are functionally and anatomically connected and whether they correlate with the severity of neglect. Here we report a retrospective study on 33 right brain damaged patients with neglect after right hemisphere lesions in whom we measured the intensity of perseveration of the three following kinds: (1) ‘additional marks' (AM) perseveration where patients cancelled a target with two or more well separated marks; (2) ‘scribble’ perseveration, where patients, instead of cancelling the target with a single pen stroke as required by the task, performed multiple pen strokes without breaking the pen-to-paper contact, with the ﬁnal product being a scribble; (3) ‘ﬂying marks’ (FM) perseveration where patients produced cancellation marks well away from the targets. We found that AM and FM perseveration correlated with neglect severity, while ‘scribble’ perseveration did not. The lesion-symptom mapping showed three separate anatomical areas in the right hemisphere: ‘scribble’ perseveration was associated with lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus; AM perseveration was associated with damage to the rolandic operculum, superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus; FM perseveration was associated with damage to the dorsal premotor cortex and the temporal pole. Neglect severity followed damage to a region which grossly corresponds to the sum of the regions associated with AM and FM perseveration respectively. This complex behavioural and anatomical pattern is interpreted in terms of a three-factor model, in which AM perseveration is caused by a deﬁcit of disengagement of attention from the right side (also causing omissions), FM perseveration is caused by directional hypokinesia (also causing left-side omissions), and ‘scribble’ perseveration is the consequence of a failure to inhibit an initiated motor act, which is completely separate (both anatomically and functionally) from the disorder inducing omissions.},

	abstract = {Spatial neglect is a characterized by a failure to attend or make movements towards left-sided stimuli. Common pa-per-and-pencil tasks to diagnose spatial neglect are sensitive to perseverative errors, including additional marks over already cancelled targets and “scribbling” out a target. Here, we examine whether functionally distinct perseverative behaviors are related to spatial neglect. Line cancellation tasks of 45 healthy controls and 220 right-hemisphere stroke survivors were examined for recurrent marks (RM) and continuous marks (CM) perseverations. We found that RM perseveration correlated with neglect severity, while CM perseveration did not. Examination of lesion profiles for the two groups indicated distinct anatomical correlates, with RM lesions overlapping regions implicated in spatial neglect including the rolandic operculum, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule.},

	abstract = {Objective: Fatigue is a common consequence of stroke that frequently co-occurs with depression. Data on the cognitive associations of post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is scarce. We investigated the relationship of PSF with depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning after stroke.
Methods: One hundred and thirty-three working-aged patients with ﬁrst-ever ischaemic strokes underwent neuropsychological and clinical assessment and evaluation for PSF and depressive symptoms at three months, six months, and two years after stroke. Cognitive domains evaluated included processing speed, memory, executive functions, and reasoning. Fatigue and depressive symptoms were assessed with subscales of the Proﬁle of Mood States.
Results: Patients (mean age: 54 ± 9.5 years, 64.7\% male) were divided into groups with (n = 33) and without (n = 100) PSF at three months after stroke. Patients with PSF at three months after stroke had slower processing speed at three months (p = 0.003) and six months (p = 0.013) after stroke and worse memory performance at six months (p = 0.003) after stroke than patients without PSF. Fatigue was also associated with more depressive symptoms. Impairments in processing speed at 3 months and memory at 6 months after stroke persisted after the depressive symptoms were controlled for. PSF was related to a lower rate of returning to work two years after stroke (p = 0.046).
Conclusion: PSF at three months after stroke is associated with depressive symptoms and negative cognitive and work-related outcomes following stroke. Deﬁcits in processing speed and memory in patients with PSF were partly observed even after depressive symptoms were controlled for.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Cognitive impairment is common after stroke, but the prevalence and long-term signiﬁcance of the diverse neuropsychological deﬁcits on functional outcome are still not well known. The frequency and prognostic value of domain-speciﬁc cognitive impairments were investigated in a large cohort of ischaemic stroke patients.
Methods: Consecutive patients (n = 409), aged 55–85 years, from the acute stroke unit of the Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, were evaluated with extensive clinical and neuropsychological assessments 3 months post-stroke. Impairments within nine cognitive domains were determined according to ageappropriate normative data from a random healthy population. Functional disability was evaluated with the modiﬁed Rankin scale (mRS) 3 and 15 months post-stroke.
Results: In all, 83\% patients showed impairment in at least one cognitive domain, whereas 50\% patients were impaired in multiple (≥3) domains. In cases with excellent clinical recovery at 3 months (mRS = 0–1, no disability), the occurrence of any cognitive impairment was 71\%. Memory, visuoconstructional and executive functions were most commonly impaired. A substantially smaller proportion of patients scored below the conventional or more stringent cut-oﬀs in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Domain-speciﬁc cognitive impairments were associated with functional dependence at 15 months regardless of stroke severity and other confounders.
Conclusions: Cognitive impairment as evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is prevalent in stroke survivors even with successful clinical recovery. Typically multiple domains and complex cognitive abilities are aﬀected. MMSE is not sensitive in detecting these symptoms. Post-stroke cognitive impairment is strongly related to poor functional outcome.},

We conducted a systematic search in PubMed up to March 2019 with search terms for stroke and memory. Studies on adult stroke patients, that included a control group, and assessed working memory function, were selected. Effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were extracted from 50 studies (in total 3,084 stroke patients) based on the sample size, mean and standard deviation of patients and controls. Performance of stroke patients was compared to healthy controls on low-load (i.e. capacity) and high-load (executively demanding) working memory tasks, grouped by modality (verbal, nonverbal). A separate analysis compared patients in the sub-acute and the chronic stage. Longitudinal studies and effects of lesion location were systematically reviewed. Stroke patients demonstrated significant deficits in working memory with a moderate effect size for both low-load (Hedges’ g = -.58 [-.82 to -.43]) and high-load (Hedges’ g = -.59 [-.73 to -.45]) tasks. The effect sizes were comparable for verbal and non-verbal material. Systematically reviewing the literature showed that working memory deficits remain prominent in the chronic stage of stroke. Lesions in a widespread fronto-parietal network are associated with working memory deficits. Stroke patients show decrements of moderate magnitude in all subsystems of working memory. This review clearly demonstrates the global nature of the impairment in working memory post-stroke.},

We included retrospectively from our stroke data bank 16 patients (right- and left-handed, and ambidextrous) with aphasia after a single ﬁrst-ever ischemic RH stroke. A control group was composed of 25 successive patients with left hemispheric stroke and aphasia (LHSA). For each patient, we analyzed four modalities of language (spontaneous ﬂuency, naming, repetition, and comprehension) and recorded eventual impairment: (1) on admission (hyperacute) and (2) between day 3 and 14 (acute). Lesion volume and location as measured on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were transformed into Talairach stereotaxic space. Nonparametric statistics were used to compare impaired/nonimpaired patients. Comprehension and repetition were less frequently impaired after RHSA (respectively, 56\% and 50\%) than after LHSA (respectively, 84\% and 80\%, P = 0.05 and 0.04) only at hyperacute phase.},

METHODS: Motor perseverative behavior during line cancellation task was evaluated retrospectively in 60 patients with left hemispatial neglect from right hemispheric stroke.
RESULTS: More than 30\% of the patients (21 of 60) showed perseveration, manifested as either repetitive cancellation of the same target (18/21) or cancelling extra lines created by the patients themselves (3/21). Neglect severity correlated positively with the frequency of perseverative errors. Perseveration was most prominent in the rightmost portion of the array. Anterior lesions or massive lesions involving anterior and posterior regions were more likely to be associated with motor perseveration than were lesions restricted to posterior areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanism of motor perseveration remains to be elucidated, our findings suggest that the combination of aberrant approach behaviors associated with frontal lobe injury and an attentional or intentional bias toward the rightsided targets might explain the behavior.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive impairment as a complication in post-stroke patients has high prevalence throughout the world. However, few studies have focused on the older adult stroke survivors and explored their prevalence and factors of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). The study aims to evaluate the cognitive status of stroke patients in Hunan Province, China and to determine the potential risk factors associated with PSCI in order to identify the older adult population in advance and promote healthy aging.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out from August to December, 2021. A total of 520 stroke survivors from 6 tertiary hospitals were randomly selected. The information was collected using the general questionnaire, the Barthel Index Rating Scale and the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE). Analysis was based on descriptive statistics, chi-square test and the significant variables were included in multivariate logistic regression. The reporting of this cross-sectional study followed the STROBE checklist.
Results: A total of 195 older adults (40.37\%) were screened for cognitive impairment based on the results of the MMSE score. Patients in the PSCI group had a higher proportion of individuals aged 70 or older (35.90\% vs. 24.65\%, p{\textless}0.001). The potential risk factors for post-stroke cognitive impairment in older adults were being aged between 70 and 79  years old (OR  =  3.973, 95\% CI, 2.346–6.729, p{\textless}0.001), being aged 80  years or older (OR  =  3.590, 95\% CI, 1.373–9.387, p  =  0.009), having a low level of education (OR  =  9.183, 95\% CI, 5.341–15.789, p{\textless}0.001), having hypertension (OR  =  1.756, 95\% CI, 1.121–2.753, p  =  0.014), and having a dominant hemisphere lesion (OR  =  1.880, 95\% CI, 1.193–2.962, p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusion: The prevalence of PSCI was high among Chinese older adults, particularly those aged 80  years or older. The factors identified in our study could assist in the early identification of older adults at risk, develop personalized management plans, and promote healthy aging.},

	abstract = {Objective: Spatial neglect (SN) impedes stroke rehabilitation progress, slows functional recovery, and increases caregiver stress and burden. The estimation of SN prevalence varies widely across studies.
Background: We aimed to establish the prevalence of SN based on the injured cerebral hemisphere, recovery stage post-stroke, and diagnostic methodology. Materials and methods: All journal articles published up to February 27, 2019 from CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science were searched. We selected original research articles that described observational studies, included both individuals with left brain damage (LBD) and those with right brain damage (RBD) post-stroke, and reported speciﬁc diagnostic methods for SN. All authors reached consensus for the ﬁnal selection of 41 articles. Time post-stroke, patient selection criteria, study setting, SN diagnostic methods were extracted.
Results: A total of 6324 participants were included: 3411 (54\%) with RBD and 2913 (46\%) with LBD. Without considering time post-stroke or diagnostic methods, the occurrence rate of SN was 29\% (38\% after RBD and 18\% after LBD). Using ecological assessments resulted in higher prevalence than using tests not directly related to daily life activities (53\% vs. 24\%). Using methods based on a single-cutoff criterion led to lower occurrence of SN than using multi-test methods (27\% vs. 33\%). The prevalence decreased from the acute to chronic stage post-stroke.
Conclusions: The estimated prevalence of SN after unilateral stroke is 30\%. SN is more common after RBD than after LBD, but SN after LBD is still quite common. Using ecological assessments and multi-test methods to detect SN is preferred to using a single-cutoff criterion of a test that is not directly related to daily function. The decrease in SN prevalence over time is evident, but the exact prevalence in later stages cannot be estimated. More research is needed to better understand chronic SN.},

	abstract = {Unilateral spatial neglect refers to a difﬁculty in detecting or acting on information in a particular region of space. When asked to cross out stimuli distributed across a page, patients with neglect may miss many targets on the left. In addition, they have a tendency to return to, and re-mark, right-sided targets that they have already cancelled. A recent retrospective study has shown this effect to be speciﬁc to unilateral neglect rather than a consequence of right hemisphere damage in general. Here, a consecutive group of seven right-hemisphere neglect patients performed ﬁve versions of a standard cancellation task, each version differing in the quantity of left-sided information presented. All of the participants showed perseveration on right-sided targets in the basic task. A highly signiﬁcant and linear reduction in perseverative behaviour was observed as left-sided information was removed. In a second study, left-sided targets were again progressively removed but, in this case, were replaced with an additional distracter item, keeping the total quantity of stimuli presented in each condition constant. Again, a signiﬁcant reduction in right-sided perseveration was observed, indicating a high degree of selectivity to the effect. The results show that a difﬁculty in perceiving existing cancellation marks, or a non-spatially speciﬁc motoric perseveration, are unlikely to fully account for this behaviour. As the patients omitted almost all targets on the left side of the basic cancellation task, the results suggest a striking inﬂuence on apparently intentional behaviour from un-cancelled information within the neglected ﬁeld. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Moreover, previous studies described re-fixations during visual search tasks, and interpreted this finding as an impairment of spatial working memory. The aim of the present study was to study re-fixations and perseverations (i.e., recurrent re-fixations to same locations) during free visual exploration, a task with high ecological validity. We hypothesized that: (1) neglect patient would perform re-fixations more frequently than healthy controls within the right hemispace; and, (2) the re-fixation behavior of neglect patients would be characterized by perseverative fixations. To test these hypotheses, we assessed 22 neglect patients and 23 healthy controls, measuring their eye movements during free exploration of naturalistic pictures. The results showed that neglect patients tend to re-fixate locations within the ipsilesional hemispace when they freely explore naturalistic pictures. Importantly, the saliency of discrete locations within the pictures has a stronger influence on fixation behavior within the contralesional than within the ipsilesional hemispace in neglect patients. Finally, the results indicated that, for re-fixations, saliency plays a more important role within the contralesional than the ipsilesional hemispace. Moreover, we found evidence that re-fixation behavior of neglect patients is characterized by frequent recurrent re-fixations back to the same spatial locations which may be interpreted as perseverations. Hence, with the present study, we could better elucidate the mechanism leading to re-fixations and perseverative behavior during free visual exploration in neglect patients.},

We enrolled 87 consecutive patients with diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted imaging, and spatial neglect testing within 24 hours of right hemisphere ischemic stroke. The degrees of spatial neglect and perseveration were analyzed. Perseveration was apparent in 46\% (40/87) of the patients; 28\% (24/87) showed perseveration only; 18\% (16/87) showed both perseveration and neglect; and 3\% (3/87) showed neglect only. Perseverative behaviors occur in an inverted “U” shape: little neglect was associated with few perseverations; moderate neglect with high perseverations; and in severe neglect targets may not enter consciousness and perseverative responses decrease. Brodmann areas of dysfunction, and the caudate and putament, were assessed and volumetrically measured. In this study, the caudate and putamen were not associated with perseveration. After controlling for neglect, and volume of dysfunctional tissue, only Brodmann area 46 was associated with perseveration. Our results further support the notion that perseveration and neglect are distinct entities; while they often co-occur, acute dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ischemia is associated with perseveration speciﬁcally.},

Moreover, they can show a perseverative behaviour, which consists in repeatedly cancelling stimuli, mainly in the side of the display ipsilateral to the side of the lesion (ipsilesional). We investigated in 13 right‐brain‐damaged patients with left spatial neglect and perseverative behaviour whether and how different densities of horizontal targets modulated omission and perseverative errors. We found that the density of targets modulated the patients’ distribution of neglect (area of omission), but not its extent, as indexed by the percentage of omissions. Specifically, the area of omissions tightened when target density increased leftwards. On the other hand, target density did not affect the distribution of perseverative behaviour (area of perseveration), as well as its extent, as indexed by the percentage of perseverations. Correlation analyses showed that both the extent and the distribution of omissions were positively correlated to clinical measures of spatial neglect. Conversely, perseverations did not show such a correlation. These findings support the view that two different pathological mechanisms might be involved in left spatial neglect and in ipsilesional perseverative behaviour.},

METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with right or left hemisphere stroke were enrolled in a cohort study and tested for linguistic and affective prosody perception and musical pitch and rhythm perception at subacute and 3-month poststroke stages. Participants listened to words spoken with different prosodic stress that changed their meaning, and to words spoken with six different emotions, and chose which meaning or emotion was expressed. In the music tasks, participants judged pairs of short melodies as the same or different in terms of pitch or rhythm. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at both stages, and machine learning-based lesion-symptom mapping and deterministic tractography were used to identify lesion patterns and damaged white matter pathways giving rise to aprosodia and amusia.
RESULTS: Both aprosodia and amusia were behaviorally strongly correlated and associated with similar lesion patterns in right frontoinsular and striatal areas. In multiple regression models, reduced fractional anisotropy and lower tract volume of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were the strongest predictors for both disorders, over time.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight a common origin of aprosodia and amusia, both arising from damage and disconnection of the right ventral auditory stream integrating rhythmic-melodic acoustic information in prosody and music. Comorbidity of these disabilities may worsen the prognosis and affect rehabilitation success.},

            Some individuals show a congenital deficit for music processing despite normal peripheral auditory processing, cognitive functioning, and music exposure. This condition, termed congenital amusia, is typically approached regarding its profile of musical and pitch difficulties. Here, we examine whether amusia also affects socio-emotional processing, probing auditory and visual domains. Thirteen adults with amusia and 11 controls completed two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants judged emotions in emotional speech prosody, nonverbal vocalizations (e.g., crying), and (silent) facial expressions. Target emotions were: amusement, anger, disgust, fear, pleasure, relief, and sadness. Compared to controls, amusics were impaired for all stimulus types, and the magnitude of their impairment was similar for auditory and visual emotions. In Experiment 2, participants listened to spontaneous and posed laughs, and either inferred the authenticity of the speaker’s state, or judged how much laughs were contagious. Amusics showed decreased sensitivity to laughter authenticity, but normal contagion responses. Across the experiments, mixed-effects models revealed that the acoustic features of vocal signals predicted socio-emotional evaluations in both groups, but the profile of predictive acoustic features was different in amusia. These findings suggest that a developmental music disorder can affect socio-emotional cognition in subtle ways, an impairment not restricted to auditory information.},

	abstract = {Fundamental frequency (ƒ0), perceived as pitch, is the first and arguably most salient auditory component humans are exposed to since the beginning of life. It carries multiple linguistic (e.g., word meaning) and paralinguistic (e.g., speakers’ emotion) functions in speech and communication. The mappings between these functions and ƒ0 features vary within a language and differ cross-linguistically. For instance, a rising pitch can be perceived as a question in English but a lexical tone in Mandarin. Such variations mean that infants must learn the specific mappings based on their respective linguistic and social environments. To date, canonical theoretical frameworks and most empirical studies do not view or consider the multi-functionality of ƒ0, but typically focus on individual functions. More importantly, despite the eventual mastery of ƒ0 in communication, it is unclear how infants learn to decompose and recognize these overlapping functions carried by ƒ0. In this paper, we review the symbioses and synergies of the lexical, intonational, and emotional functions that can be carried by ƒ0 and are being acquired throughout infancy. On the basis of our review, we put forward the Learnability Hypothesis that infants decompose and acquire multiple ƒ0 functions through native/environmental experiences. Under this hypothesis, we propose representative cases such as the synergy scenario, where infants use visual cues to disambiguate and decompose the different ƒ0 functions. Further, viable ways to test the scenarios derived from this hypothesis are suggested across auditory and visual modalities. Discovering how infants learn to master the diverse functions carried by ƒ0 can increase our understanding of linguistic systems, auditory processing and communication functions.},

            Languages can use a common repertoire of vocal sounds to signify distinct meanings. In tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, pitch contours of syllables distinguish one word from another, whereas in non-tonal languages, such as English, pitch is used to convey intonation. The neural computations underlying language specialization in speech perception are unknown. Here, we use a cross-linguistic approach to address this. Native Mandarin- and English- speaking participants each listened to both Mandarin and English speech, while neural activity was directly recorded from the non-primary auditory cortex. Both groups show language-general coding of speaker-invariant pitch at the single electrode level. At the electrode population level, we find language-specific distribution of cortical tuning parameters in Mandarin speakers only, with enhanced sensitivity to Mandarin tone categories. Our results show that speech perception relies upon a shared cortical auditory feature processing mechanism, which may be tuned to the statistics of a given language.},

            Aphasia is an acquired impairment in the production or comprehension of language, typically caused by left hemisphere stroke. The subtyping framework used in clinical aphasiology today is based on the Wernicke-Lichtheim model of aphasia formulated in the late 19th century, which emphasizes the distinction between language production and comprehension. The current study used a data-driven approach that combined modern statistical, machine learning, and neuroimaging tools to examine behavioural deficit profiles and their lesion correlates and predictors in a large cohort of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. First, individuals with aphasia were clustered based on their behavioural deficit profiles using community detection analysis (CDA) and these clusters were compared with the traditional aphasia subtypes. Random forest classifiers were built to evaluate how well individual lesion profiles predict cluster membership. The results of the CDA analyses did not align with the traditional model of aphasia in either behavioural or neuroanatomical patterns. Instead, the results suggested that the primary distinction in aphasia (after severity) is between phonological and semantic processing rather than between production and comprehension. Further, lesion-based classification reached 75\% accuracy for the CDA-based categories and only 60\% for categories based on the traditional fluent/non-fluent aphasia distinction. The results of this study provide a data-driven basis for a new approach to classification of post-stroke aphasia subtypes in both research and clinical settings.},

Over the past few years, behavioral and neuroimaging studies have shown that rehabilitation interventions can promote neuroplastic changes in aphasic patients that may be associated with the improvement of language functions. Following left-hemisphere strokes, the functional reorganization of language in aphasic patients has been proposed to involve both intrahemispheric interactions between damaged left-hemisphere and perilesional sites and transcallosal interhemispheric interactions between the lesioned left-hemisphere language areas and homotopic regions in the right hemisphere. A growing body of evidence for such reorganization comes from studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), two safe and noninvasive procedures that can be applied clinically to modulate cortical excitability during poststroke language recovery. We discuss a hierarchical model for the plastic changes in language representation that occur in the setting of dominant hemisphere stroke and aphasia. We further argue that TMS and tDCS are potentially promising tools for enhancing functional recovery of language and for further elucidating mechanisms of plasticity in patients with aphasia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: State-of-the-art stroke treatment significantly reduces lesion size and stroke severity, but it remains unclear whether these therapeutic advances have diminished the burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).
AIMS: In a cohort of patients receiving modern state-of-the-art stroke care including endovascular therapy, we assessed the frequency of PSCI and the pattern of domain-specific cognitive deficits, identified risk factors for PSCI, and determined the impact of acute PSCI on stroke outcome.
METHODS: In this prospective monocentric cohort study, we examined patients with first-ever anterior circulation ischemic stroke without pre-stroke cognitive decline, using a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment ⩽10 days after symptom onset. Normative data were stratified by demographic variables. We defined PSCI as at least moderate ({\textless}1.5 standard deviation) deficits in ⩾2 cognitive domains. Multivariable regression analysis was applied to define risk factors for PSCI.
RESULTS: We analyzed 329 non-aphasic patients admitted from December 2020 to July 2023 (67.2 ± 14.4 years old, 41.3\% female, 13.1 ± 2.7 years of education). Although most patients had mild stroke (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 24 h = 1.00 (0.00; 3.00); 87.5\% with NIHSS ⩽ 5), 69.3\% of them presented with PSCI 2.7 ± 2.0 days post-stroke. The most severely and often affected cognitive domains were verbal learning, episodic memory, executive functions, selective attention, and constructive abilities (39.1\%-51.2\% of patients), whereas spatial neglect was less frequent (18.5\%). The risk of PSCI was reduced with more years of education (odds ratio (OR) = 0.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.99) and right hemisphere lesions (OR = 0.47, 95\% CI = 0.26-0.84), and increased with stroke severity (NIHSS 24 h, OR = 4.19, 95\% CI = 2.72-6.45), presence of hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.93, 95\% CI = 1.01-3.68), but was not influenced by age. After adjusting for stroke severity and depressive symptoms, acute PSCI was associated with poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale {\textgreater} 2, F = 13.695, p {\textless} 0.001) and worse global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, F = 20.069, p {\textless} 0.001) at 3 months post-stroke.
CONCLUSION: Despite modern stroke therapy and many strokes having mild severity, PSCI in the acute stroke phase remains frequent and associated with worse outcome. The most prevalent were learning and memory deficits. Cognitive reserve operationalized as years of education independently protects post-stroke cognition.},

The syndrome of unilateral spatial neglect is one of the most disabling neuropsychological deficits caused by brain damage, most frequently in the right cerebral hemisphere. Neglect affects over 60\% of right-brain-damaged patients, particularly in the acute phase after stroke. The manifestations of neglect are manifold, and may occur independent of each other, but all of them share a divide, which distinguishes the neglected (namely, not explored, where events are undetected) from the non-neglected side of space. Clinical manifestations include not only “deficits” (such as impaired search and report of events), but also gratuitous (not required by the environmental set) productions, as perseveration behaviour of varying complexity. Different sectors of space may be selectively affected: one main distinction concerns extra-personal vs. personal, bodily space.
Patients may neglect the side of the body contralateral to the lesion, hence, after right-brain damage, the left side. Neglect for the left side of the body includes simple “defective” impairments (personal hemi-neglect, hemi-asomatognosia), and more “complex” productive delusional belief (somatoparaphrenia) concerning left body parts (most frequently, though not exclusively, the left hand). These delusions may be variably florid, ranging from the mere disownership of the left hand, to the misattribution of its ownership to another person, with a variety of arguments. These patients may be also unaware of left-sided sensori-motor deficits (anosognosia for hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, hemianopia), and this unawareness may occur independent of hemi-asomatognosia and somatoparaphrenia.
Notwithstanding the prima facie higher-level (cognitive) features of these disorders of body knowledge, the relevant neuro-functional representation of the body is mostly, though not exclusively, based on the continuous integration and updating of multisensory signals, as revealed by the effects of direction-specific sensory stimulations (e.g., vestibular caloric) on these bodily manifestations of the neglect syndrome. Also, conditions, in which a conflict between senses (i.e., somatic sensation and vision, as in the Rubber Hand Illusion) is artificially created, may modulate the disownership symptom of somatoparaphrenia in brain-damaged patients, as well as shedding light into the neurofunctional mechanisms supporting the sense of ownership of body parts, and, more generally, of the bodily self, in unimpaired individuals.
The view that putatively lower-level processes, as multisensory integration, play a most important role in different aspects of the representation of the body, and of its parts, is in line with the increasing evidence that some basic homeostatic variables are modulated by cerebral cortical activity, and by sensorimotor information known to affect spatial and bodily representations.},

To determine the range of stroke-related memory impairment, we identified all case reports and group studies through the Medline database and the Science Citation Index. There is no hypothesis about memory that is unique to stroke, but there are several important facets of memory impairment after stroke: (1) Every node of the limbic system implicated in memory may be damaged by stroke but very rarely in isolation and the combination of amnesia with the associated deficits often illuminates additional aspects of memory functions. (2) Stroke produces amnesia by damage to critical convergence white matter connections of the limbic system, and stroke is the only etiology of amnesia that can delineate the entire pathway of memory and critical convergence points. (3) Stroke also impairs memory, without causing classical amnesia, by damaging brain regions responsible for cognitive processes, some modality specific and some more generally strategic, that are essential for normal learning and recall.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-stroke anxiety and depression can be disabling and result in impaired recovery. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for anxiety and depression; however, determining its efficacy among those with stroke is warranted. Our objectives to evaluate CBT for anxiety and depression post-stroke .
METHODS: This review was registered with PROSPERO (REG\# CRD42020186324). Medline, PsycInfo, and EMBR Cochrane were used to locate studies published before May 2020, using keywords such as stroke and CBT. A study was included if: (1) interventions were CBT-based, targeting anxiety and/or depression; (2) participants experienced a stroke at least 3 months previous; (3) participants were at least 18 years old. Standardized mean differences ± standard errors and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated, and heterogeneity was determined. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used.
RESULTS: The search yielded 563 articles, of which 10 (N = 672) were included;6 were randomized controlled trials. Primary reasons for exclusion included: (1) wrong population (2) insufficient data provided for a meta-analysis; (3) wrongoutcomes. CBT showed large effects on reducing overall anxiety (SMD ± SE: 1.01 ± 0.32, p {\textless} .001) and depression (SMD ± SE: 0.95 ± 0.22, p {\textless} .000) symptoms at the end of the studies. CBT moderately maintained anxiety (SDM ± SE: 0.779 ± 0.348, p ˂.025) and depression (SDM ± SE: 0.622 ± 0.285, p ˂ .029) scores after 3-months. Limitations included small sample size, limited comparators, and lack of follow-up data.
CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis provide substantial evidence for the use of CBTto manage post-stroke anxiety and depression.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Stroke remains a leading disabling condition, and many survivors have permanent disability despite acute stroke treatment and subsequent standard-of-care rehabilitation therapies. Adjunctive neuromodulation is an emerging frontier in the field of stroke recovery. In this narrative review, we aim to highlight and summarize various neuromodulation techniques currently being investigated to enhance recovery and reduce impairment in patients with stroke.
RECENT FINDINGS: For motor recovery, repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation (rTMS) and direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promising results in many smaller-scale trials. Still, their efficacy has yet to be proven in large-scale pivotal trials. A promising large-scale study investigating higher dose tDCS combined with constraint movement therapy to enhance motor recovery is currently underway. MRI-guided tDCS studies in subacute and chronic post-stroke aphasia showed promising benefits for picture-naming recovery. rTMS, particularly inhibitory stimulation over the contralesional homolog, could represent a pathway forward in post-stroke motor recovery in the setting of a well-designed and adequately powered clinical trial. Recently evidenced-based guideline actually supported Level A (definite efficacy) for the use of low-frequency rTMS of the primary motor cortex for hand motor recovery in the post-acute stage of stroke based on the meta-analysis result. Adjunctive vagal nerve stimulation has recently received FDA approval to enhance upper limb motor recovery in chronic ischemic stroke with moderate impairment, and progress has been made to implement it in real-world practice. Despite a few small and large-scale studies in epidural stimulation (EDS), further research on the utilization of EDS in post-stroke recovery is needed. Deep brain stimulation or stent-based neuromodulation has yet to be further tested regarding safety and efficacy. Adjunctive neuromodulation to rehabilitation therapy is a promising avenue for promoting post-stroke recovery and decreasing the overall burden of disability. The pipeline for neuromodulation technology remains strong as they span from the preclinical stage to the post-market stage. We are optimistic to see that more neuromodulation tools will be available to stroke survivors in the not-to-distant future.},

In this review, invasive neuromodulation techniques to augment the effects of conventional rehabilitation methods are described, including vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In addition, the evidence base for each of these techniques, pivotal trials, and future directions are explored. Finally, emerging technologies such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and the shift to artificial intelligence-enabled implants and wearables are examined. While the field of implantable devices for chronic stroke recovery is still in a nascent stage, the data reviewed are suggestive of immense potential for reducing the impact and impairment from this globally prevalent disorder.},

Here, we systematically review the effectiveness of rt-fMRI neurofeedback training in modulating motor and cognitive processes that are often impaired after stroke. Based on predefined search criteria, we selected and examined 33 rt-fMRI neurofeedback studies, including 651 healthy individuals and 15 stroke patients in total. The results of our systematic review suggest that rt-fMRI neurofeedback training can lead to a learned modulation of brain signals, with associated changes at both the neural and the behavioural level.

	abstract = {Introduction: 
          Cognitive-communication disorders are common in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can have a major impact on long-term outcome. Guidelines for evidence-informed rehabilitation are needed, thus an international group of researchers and clinicians (known as INCOG) convened to develop recommendations for assessment and intervention.
          Methods: 
          An expert panel met to select appropriate recommendations for assessment and treatment of cognitive-communication disorders based on available literature. To promote implementation, the team developed decision algorithms incorporating the recommendations, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria of published trials, and then prioritized recommendations for implementation and developed audit criteria to evaluate adherence to best practice recommendations.
          Results: 
          Rehabilitation of individuals with cognitive-communication disorders should consider premorbid communication status; be individualized to the person's needs, goals, and skills; provide training in use of assistive technology where appropriate; include training of communication partners; and occur in context to minimize the need for generalization. Evidence supports treatment of social communication problems in a group format.
          Conclusion: 
          There is strong evidence for person-centered treatment of cognitive-communication disorders and use of instructional strategies such as errorless learning, metacognitive strategy training, and group treatment. Future studies should include tests of alternative service delivery models and development of participation-level outcome measures.},

Prosody is characterized as an abstract structure composed of discrete tonal elements aligned with the segmental composition of the sentence organized in constituents of increasing size, and this structure is influenced by the phonological, syntactic, and informational structures of the sentence. Here, we discuss evidence that listeners are affected by prosody when establishing those linguistic structures. Prosody has been shown to influence the segmentation of the utterance into syllables and words, and, in some cases, whether a syllable or word is judged to be present or not. The literature on how prosody informs the structural relationship between words and phrases is also discussed, contrasting views that assume a direct (albeit probabilistic) link between syntax and prosody with those that posit a complex interface between syntax and prosodic structure. Finally, the role of prosody in conveying important aspects pertaining to the sentence's information structure (i.e., which parts of the sentence's meaning are highlighted and brought forward to the discourse, which ones are presupposed and left in the background, which attitudes are being conveyed about the concepts or propositional content) has long been recognized. Current research focuses on which prosodic elements contribute to marking the dimensions (or semantic primitives) of the information structure.},

	abstract = {While it is well known that prosodic features are central in the conveyance of pragmatic meaning across languages, developmental research has assessed a narrow set of pragmatic functions of prosody. Research on prosodic development has focused on early infancy, with the subsequent preschool ages and beyond having received less attention. This study sets out to explore how young preschoolers develop the ability to use prosody to express pragmatic meanings while taking into account children’s Theory of Mind (ToM) development. Though ToM has been suggested to be linked to the development of receptive prosody, little is known about its relationship with expressive prosodic skills. A total of 102 3- to 4-year-old Catalan-speaking children were assessed for their pragmatic prosody skills using 35 picture-supported prompts revolving around a variety of social scenarios, as well as for their ToM skills. The responses were analyzed for prosodic appropriateness. The analyses revealed that 3- to 4-year-olds successfully produced prosody to encode basic expressive acts and unbiased speech acts such as information-seeking questions. Yet they had more trouble with complex expressive acts and biased speech acts such as the ones that convey speakers’ beliefs. Further analyses showed that ToM alone is not sufficient to explain children’s prosodic score, but the prosodic performance in some pragmatic areas (unbiased pragmatic meanings) was predicted by the interaction between ToM and age. Overall, this evidence for the acquisition of pragmatic prosody by young preschoolers demonstrates the importance of bridging the gap between prosody and pragmatics when accounting for prosodic developmental profiles, as well as taking into account the potential influence of ToM and other socio-cognitive and language skills in this development.},

METHODS: We used an auditory version of the well-studied Attention Network Test to study alerting, orienting, and executive control in 28 persons with chronic stroke (PWS). We further sought to characterize the neurobiology of each auditory attention measure in our sample using exploratory lesion-symptom mapping analyses.
RESULTS: PWS exhibited the expected executive control effect (i.e., decreased accuracy for incongruent compared to congruent trials), but their alerting and orienting attention were disrupted. PWS did not exhibit an alerting effect and they were actually distracted by the auditory spatial orienting cue compared to the control cue. Lesion-symptom mapping indicated that poorer alerting and orienting were associated with damage to the left retrolenticular part of the internal capsule (adjacent to the thalamus) and left posterior middle frontal gyrus (overlapping with the frontal eye fields), respectively.
DISCUSSION: The behavioral findings correspond to our previous work investigating alerting and spatial orienting attention in persons with aphasia in the visual modality and suggest that auditory alerting and spatial orienting attention may be impaired in PWS due to stroke lesions damaging multi-modal attention resources.},

The purpose of this study was to obtain information about speech-language pathologists' (SLPs') clinical practices and decision making for this population to understand what practices are being used and identify gaps in clinical practice. Method A survey was distributed via online ASHA Communities for the Special Interest Groups and other social media platforms. Respondents included 143 SLPs from across the United States representing 3-50 years of experience and a wide range of practice settings. Survey questions probed assessment practices including how tests are selected, what tests are used to diagnose specific deficits, and how confident SLPs were in their diagnoses. Treatment decisions were queried for a small set of disorders. Results SLPs routinely assess cognitive disorders using standardized tests. Communication disorders are less likely to be formally assessed. Three core right cerebral hemisphere deficits-anosognosia, aprosodia, and pragmatic deficits-are either not assessed or assessed only through observation by 80\% of SLPs. Evidence-based treatments are commonly used for disorders of attention, awareness, and aprosodia. Conclusion Communication disorders are less likely to be formally assessed than cognitive disorders, creating a critical gap in care that cannot be filled by other allied health professionals. Suggestions for free or low-cost resources for evaluating pragmatics, prosody, and awareness are provided to aid SLPs in filling this gap.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an increasingly popular clinical screening tool for detecting cognitive impairment in stroke, but few studies have directly compared performance on the MoCA with neuropsychological assessment. Our retrospective study examined the extent to which intact performance on the MoCA reflects intact cognition as determined by neuropsychological assessment.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, cognitive profiles for 136 acute stroke patients admitted to the Acute Stroke Unit who had available MoCA and neuropsychological assessment data were examined.
RESULTS: 22\% of our patients were deemed cognitively intact on the MoCA. Of these, 78\% were found to be impaired (≤ 5\%ile) on neuropsychological assessment in one or more cognitive domains. The most common impairments were in general intelligence, information processing speed and visual memory; three areas not assessed by the MoCA. In addition, a high proportion (up to 59\%) of patients who scored the maximum points in one of the MoCA-specified domains were impaired on comparable neuropsychological assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that although the MoCA may be a useful screening tool post-stroke in detecting gross impairments, neuropsychological assessment is still necessary for a comprehensive and reliable detection of domain-specific cognitive deficits, which can more reliably inform us for realistic goal setting and vocational advice vital for effective rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stroke lesions in non-auditory areas may affect higher-order central auditory processing. We sought to characterize auditory functions in chronic stroke survivors with unilateral arm/hand impairment using auditory evoked responses (AERs) with lesion and perception metrics.
METHODS: The AERs in 29 stroke survivors and 14 controls were recorded with single tones, active and passive frequency-oddballs, and a dual-oddball with pitch-contour and time-interval deviants. Performance in speech-in-noise, mistuning detection, and moving-sound detection was assessed. Relationships between AERs, behaviour, and lesion overlap with functional networks, were examined.
RESULTS: Despite their normal hearing, eight patients showed unilateral AER in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected hand with reduced amplitude compared to those with bilateral AERs. Both groups showed increasing attenuation of later components. Hemispheric asymmetry of AER sources was reduced in bilateral-AER patients. The N1 wave (100 ms latency) and P2 (200 ms) were delayed in individuals with lesions in the basal-ganglia and white-matter, while lesions in the attention network reduced the frequency-MMN (mismatch negativity) responses and increased the pitch-contour P3a response. Patients' impaired speech-in-noise perception was explained by AER measures and frequency-deviant detection performance with multiple regression.
CONCLUSION: AERs reflect disruption of auditory functions due to damage outside of temporal lobe, and further explain complexity of neural mechanisms underlying higher-order auditory perception.
SIGNIFICANCE: Stroke survivors without obvious hearing problems may benefit from rehabilitation for central auditory processing.},

Studies of neurotypical controls indicate that prosody can aid comprehension by facilitating attention towards critical pitch inflections and phrase boundaries. However, no studies have examined how prosody may engage specific cognitive and neural resources during non-canonical sentence comprehension in persons with left hemisphere damage. Experiment 1 examines the relationship between comprehension of non-canonical sentences spoken with typical and atypical prosody and several cognitive measures in 25 persons with chronic left hemisphere stroke and 20 matched controls. Experiment 2 explores the neural resources critical for non-canonical sentence comprehension with each prosody type using region-of-interest-based multiple regressions. Lower orienting attention abilities and greater inferior frontal and parietal damage predicted lower comprehension, but only for sentences with typical prosody. Our results suggest that typical sentence prosody may engage attention resources to support non-canonical sentence comprehension, and this relationship may be disrupted following left hemisphere stroke.},

	abstract = {PurposeLimited evidence exists to guide the assessment and treatment of cognitive-communication disorders associated with right hemisphere stroke. The purpose of this study was to obtain information about speech-language pathologists' (SLPs') clinical practices and decision making for this population to understand what practices are being used and identify gaps in clinical practice.MethodA survey was distributed via online ASHA Communities for the Special Interest Groups and other social media platforms. Respondents included 143 SLPs from across the United States representing 3–50 years of experience and a wide range of practice settings. Survey questions probed assessment practices including how tests are selected, what tests are used to diagnose specific deficits, and how confident SLPs were in their diagnoses. Treatment decisions were queried for a small set of disorders.ResultsSLPs routinely assess cognitive disorders using standardized tests. Communication disorders are less likely to be formally assessed. Three core right cerebral hemisphere deficits—anosognosia, aprosodia, and pragmatic deficits—are either not assessed or assessed only through observation by 80\% of SLPs. Evidence-based treatments are commonly used for disorders of attention, awareness, and aprosodia.ConclusionCommunication disorders are less likely to be formally assessed than cognitive disorders, creating a critical gap in care that cannot be filled by other allied health professionals. Suggestions for free or low-cost resources for evaluating pragmatics, prosody, and awareness are provided to aid SLPs in filling this gap.Supplemental Materialhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.12159597},

The present study investigated whether alaryngeal speakers not selected on grounds of proficiency were able to convey pitch accent (a pitch accent is realized on the word that is in focus, cf. Bolinger, 1958). The participating speakers (10 tracheoesophageal, 9 esophageal, and 10 laryngeal [control] speakers) produced sentences in which accent was cued by the preceding context. For each utterance, a group of listeners identified which word conveyed accent. All speakers were able to convey accent. Acoustic analyses showed that some alaryngeal speakers had little or no control over fundamental frequency. Contrary to expectation, these speakers did not compensate by using nonmelodic cues, whereas speakers using F0 did use nonmelodic cues. Thus, temporal and intensity cues are concomitant with the use of F0; if F0 is affected, these nonmelodic cues will be as well. A pitch perception experiment confirmed that alaryngeal speakers who had no control over F0 and who did not use nonmelodic cues were nevertheless able to produce pitch movements. Speakers with no control over F0 apparently relied on an alternative pitch system to convey accents and other pitch movements.},

	abstract = {This review provides a summary of the most recent advances on the study of how prosody is used during language comprehension. Prosody is characterized as an abstract structure composed of discrete tonal elements aligned with the segmental composition of the sentence organized in constituents of increasing size, and this structure is influenced by the phonological, syntactic, and informational structures of the sentence. Here, we discuss evidence that listeners are affected by prosody when establishing those linguistic structures. Prosody has been shown to influence the segmentation of the utterance into syllables and words, and, in some cases, whether a syllable or word is judged to be present or not. The literature on how prosody informs the structural relationship between words and phrases is also discussed, contrasting views that assume a direct (albeit probabilistic) link between syntax and prosody with those that posit a complex interface between syntax and prosodic structure. Finally, the role of prosody in conveying important aspects pertaining to the sentence's information structure (i.e., which parts of the sentence's meaning are highlighted and brought forward to the discourse, which ones are presupposed and left in the background, which attitudes are being conveyed about the concepts or propositional content) has long been recognized. Current research focuses on which prosodic elements contribute to marking the dimensions (or semantic primitives) of the information structure.

A change in pitch level features a step change whereas that in pitch contour features a continuous variation in voice pitch. Currently, relatively little is known about the hemispheric lateralization for the processing of each dimension. To address this issue, we made whole-head electrical recordings of mismatch negativity in native Chinese speakers in response to the contrast of Chinese lexical tones in each dimension. We found that pre-attentive auditory processing of pitch level was obviously lateralized to the right hemisphere whereas there is a tendency for that of pitch contour to be lateralized to the left. We also found that the brain responded faster to pitch level than to pitch contour at a pre-attentive stage. These results indicate that the hemispheric lateralization for early auditory processing of lexical tones depends on the pitch level and pitch contour, and suggest an underlying inter-hemispheric interactive mechanism for the processing.},

Has claimed that the basic contours of Mandarin tone are coextensive only with the syllabic vowel and any voiced segment that may follow it, any portion of fundamental frequency (F0) preceding them is merely an anticipatory adjustment of the voice. This is true insofar as tones are considered in isolated citation form. However, in connected speech, it has been found that Mandarin tones are perturbed due to tonal coarticulation, viz., a portion of F0 of syllabic vowels is affected X.-N. S. Shen, 1990. “Tonal Coarticulartion in Mandarin,” Journal of Phonetics18. 281–295. Because of the carryover effects of the preceding tone, the adjustment of the voice in a subsequent tone is not only anticipatory, it is also preservative. A perceptual experiment was conducted to examine whether carryover coarticulatory perturbations occurring at syllabic vowels in excised tones were perceptible. The results show that listeners identified above chance-level, the F0 perturbations under carryover effects in excised tones and the perturbations at initial syllabic vowels are better identified. Therefore, the concept of tone in Mandarin is revised as follows: in connected speech, a portion of fundamental frequency at intertonemic onset is perturbed — this includes initial voiced consonants and vowels (syllabic and nonsyllabic are alike); the perturbations result from preservative as well as anticipatory adjustments of the voice. This study suggest also that, F0 being an acoustic attribute in the signals and tone being a linguistic unit, their relation is a many-to-one relation. In acoustical study of tones in connected speech, tonal perturbations must be taken into consideration, when measuring F0, to determine the phonetic tones; moreover, the acoustic properties of tones in isolated citation form are not appropriate for use as norms.},

To determine if the two brain-damaged groups were exhibiting a similar pattern of performance with respect to their use of acoustic cues, the 16 stimulus utterances were analyzed acoustically, and the results were incorporated into an analysis of the errors made by the patients. A discriminant function analysis using acoustic cues alone indicated that fundamental frequency (FO) variability, mean FO, and syllable durations most successfully distinguished the four emotional sentence types. A similar analysis that incorporated the misclassifications made by the patients revealed that the left-hemisphere-damaged and right-hemisphere-damaged groups were utilizing these acoustic cues differently. The results of this and other studies suggest that rather than being lateralized to a single cerebral hemisphere in a fashion analogous to language, prosodic processes are made up of multiple skills and functions distributed across cerebral systems.},

The patients' yes-no questions also differed from normal productions, displaying smaller F0 dispersion around a mean F0. Preterminal range values were more restricted for patients' utterances of yes-no questions, while terminal properties between groups differed for three of the four sentence types examined.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine and compare lesion patterns and structural dysconnectivity underlying poststroke aprosodia and amusia, using a data-driven multimodal neuroimaging approach.
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with right or left hemisphere stroke were enrolled in a cohort study and tested for linguistic and affective prosody perception and musical pitch and rhythm perception at subacute and 3-month poststroke stages. Participants listened to words spoken with different prosodic stress that changed their meaning, and to words spoken with six different emotions, and chose which meaning or emotion was expressed. In the music tasks, participants judged pairs of short melodies as the same or different in terms of pitch or rhythm. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at both stages, and machine learning-based lesion-symptom mapping and deterministic tractography were used to identify lesion patterns and damaged white matter pathways giving rise to aprosodia and amusia.
RESULTS: Both aprosodia and amusia were behaviorally strongly correlated and associated with similar lesion patterns in right frontoinsular and striatal areas. In multiple regression models, reduced fractional anisotropy and lower tract volume of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were the strongest predictors for both disorders, over time.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight a common origin of aprosodia and amusia, both arising from damage and disconnection of the right ventral auditory stream integrating rhythmic-melodic acoustic information in prosody and music. Comorbidity of these disabilities may worsen the prognosis and affect rehabilitation success.},

METHOD: The discussion covers (a) clinical decision processes and evidence-based practice; (b) a review of right hemisphere communication deficits and existing treatment studies; (c) accounts of right hemisphere function, right hemisphere deficits, and theoretically motivated treatments; and (d) a guide for exploring and selecting treatments based on deficits rather than etiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Controlled treatment studies for communication deficits specifically for adults with right hemisphere brain damage are limited to aprosodia. For other communication deficits, clinicians may select treatments based on current theories of right hemisphere function and right hemisphere deficits, and/or treatments developed for other etiologies for which deficits are similar to those associated with right hemisphere damage.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have reported that widely used tests for aphasia identification are unable to detect the subtle language deficits of left hemisphere brain damaged (LHBD) individuals. Similarly, the language disorders of individuals with right hemisphere brain damage (RHBD) usually remain undetected, due to the lack of any specialized test for the evaluation of their language processing skills. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the language deficits of 80 individuals suffering from the effects of either a LHBD or RHBD stroke, who were diagnosed as having no aphasia or language deficits based on the application of Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. Their language abilities were examined with the use of the Adults' Language Abilities Test, which explores morpho-syntactic and semantic phenomena of the Greek language in both the comprehension and production modalities. Results revealed that both groups of stroke survivors performed significantly worse compared to the group of healthy participants. Thus, it appears that the latent aphasia of LHBD and the language deficits of RHBD patients are likely to remain undetected and that patients are at risk of not receiving appropriate treatment if their language abilities are not evaluated by an effective and efficient battery of language tests.},

Pragmatic competence mediated by the right hemisphere, is an equally important and essential component of human communication. An understanding of pragmatics permits the neuroscience nurse to identify and evaluate pragmatic deficits so interventions to facilitate communication can be undertaken. Specifically prosody, that is melody, pause, intonation, stresses and accents, affective tone, subtle grades of meaning and varied emphasis; its components; and aprosodia (lack of prosody) will be discussed.

	abstract = {Acquired language disorders after stroke are strongly associated with left hemisphere damage. When language difficulties are observed in the context of right hemisphere strokes, patients are usually considered to have atypical functional anatomy. By systematically integrating behavioural and lesion data from brain damaged patients with functional MRI data from neurologically normal participants, we investigated when and why right hemisphere strokes cause language disorders. Experiment 1 studied right-handed patients with unilateral strokes that damaged the right (n = 109) or left (n = 369) hemispheres. The most frequently impaired language task was: auditory sentence-to-picture matching after right hemisphere strokes; and spoken picture description after left hemisphere strokes. For those with auditory sentence-to-picture matching impairments after right hemisphere strokes, the majority (n = 9) had normal performance on tests of perceptual (visual or auditory) and linguistic (semantic, phonological or syntactic) processing. Experiment 2 found that these nine patients had significantly more damage to dorsal parts of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the right inferior frontal sulcus compared to 75 other patients who also had right hemisphere strokes but were not impaired on the auditory sentence-to-picture matching task. Damage to these right hemisphere regions caused long-term speech comprehension difficulties in 67\% of patients. Experiments 3 and 4 used functional MRI in two groups of 25 neurologically normal individuals to show that within the regions identified by Experiment 2, the right inferior frontal sulcus was normally activated by (i) auditory sentence-to-picture matching; and (ii) one-back matching when the demands on linguistic and non-linguistic working memory were high. Together, these experiments demonstrate that the right inferior frontal cortex contributes to linguistic and non-linguistic working memory capacity (executive function) that is needed for normal speech comprehension. Our results link previously unrelated literatures on the role of the right inferior frontal cortex in executive processing and the role of executive processing in sentence comprehension; which in turn helps to explain why right inferior frontal activity has previously been reported to increase during recovery of language function after left hemisphere stroke. The clinical relevance of our findings is that the detrimental effect of right hemisphere strokes on language is (i) much greater than expected; (ii) frequently observed after damage to the right inferior frontal sulcus; (iii) task dependent; (iv) different to the type of impairments observed after left hemisphere strokes; and (v) can result in long-lasting deficits that are (vi) not the consequence of atypical language lateralization.},

Western participants were compared to individuals from remote, culturally isolated Namibian villages. Vocalizations communicating the so-called "basic emotions" (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) were bidirectionally recognized. In contrast, a set of additional emotions was only recognized within, but not across, cultural boundaries. Our findings indicate that a number of primarily negative emotions have vocalizations that can be recognized across cultures, while most positive emotions are communicated with culture-specific signals.},

In 1860, Fechner used Weber's law to infer that the subjective sense of intensity is related to the physical intensity of a stimulus by a logarithmic function (the Weber-Fechner law). A hundred years later, Stevens refuted Fechner's law by showing that direct reports of subjective intensity are related to the physical intensity of stimuli by a power law. MacKay soon showed, however, that the logarithmic and power laws are indistinguishable without examining the underlying neural mechanisms. Mountcastle and his colleagues did so, and, on the basis of transducer functions obeying power laws, inferred that subjective intensity must be related linearly to the neural coding measure on which it is based. In this review, we discuss these issues and we review a series of studies aimed at the neural mechanisms of a very complex form of subjective experience-the experience of roughness produced by a textured surface. The results, which are independent of any assumptions about the form of the psychophysical law, support the idea that the basic law of psychophysics is linearity between subjective experience and the neural activity on which it is based.},

	abstract = {Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

	doi = {10.1121/1.2354024},
	abstract = {The experiments reported here examine the role of internal noise in the detection of a tone in narrow band noise and intensity discrimination for narrow band stimuli in school-aged children as compared to adults. Experiment 1 used 20-Hz wide bands of Gaussian and low-fluctuation noise centered at 500 Hz to assess the role of stimulus fluctuation in detection of a 500-Hz pure tone. Additional conditions tested whether performance was based on level and/or level-independent cues. Children's thresholds were elevated with respect to adults, and whereas adults benefited from the reduced fluctuation of low-fluctuation noise, children did not. Results from both groups were consistent with the use of a level cue. Experiment 2 estimated intensity increment thresholds for a narrow band Gaussian noise or a pure tone, either with or without a presentation-by-presentation level rove, an additional source of level variability. Stimulus variability was found to have a larger effect on performance of adults as compared to children, a rather counterintuitive finding if one thinks of children as more prone to informational masking introduced by stimulus variability. Both tone-in-noise and intensity discrimination data were consistent with the hypothesis that children's performance is limited by greater levels of internal noise.},

Intuition and scattered evidence suggest that these categorizations require the use of different visual information from the input. However, there is no unifying method, based on the categorization performance of subjects, that can isolate the information used. To this end, we developed Bubbles, a general technique that can assign the credit of human categorization performance to specific visual information. To illustrate the technique, we applied Bubbles on three categorization tasks (gender, expressive or not and identity) on the same set of faces, with human and ideal observers to compare the features they used.},
