    abstract = {Classiﬁcation images have recently become a widely used tool in visual psychophysics. Here, I review the development of classiﬁcation image methods over the past ﬁfteen years. I provide some historical background, describing how classiﬁcation images and related methods grew out of established statistical and mathematical frameworks and became common tools for studying biological systems. I describe key developments in classiﬁcation image methods: use of optimal weighted sums based on the linear observer model, formulation of classiﬁcation images in terms of the generalized linear model, development of statistical tests, use of priors to reduce dimensionality, methods for experiments with more than two response alternatives, a variant using multiplicative noise, and related methods for examining nonlinearities in visual processing, including secondorder Volterra kernels and principal component analysis. I conclude with a selective review of how classiﬁcation image methods have led to substantive ﬁndings in three representative areas of vision research, namely, spatial vision, perceptual organization, and visual search.},
